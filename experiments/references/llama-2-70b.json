The memory monitor is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the environment variable RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms to zero.

To avoid this, you can use a @classmethod setUpClass to start the Ray cluster once for the entire test suite and a @classmethod tearDownClass to shut it down. This will reduce the overhead to a constant, amortized quantity.

On each of the other nodes, run the command `ray start --address=<head-node-address:port>`\n\nReplace `<head-node-address:port>` with the value printed by the command on the head node (it should look something like `123.45.67.89:6379`).\n\nNote that if your compute nodes are on their own subnetwork with Network Address Translation, the address printed by the head node will not work if connecting from a machine outside that subnetwork. You will need to use a head node address reachable from the remote machine. If the head node has a domain address like `compute04.berkeley.edu`, you can simply use that in place of an IP address and rely on DNS.\n\nRay auto-detects the resources (e.g., CPU) available on each node, but you can also manually override this by passing custom resources to the `ray start` command. For example, if you wish to specify that a machine has 10 CPUs and 1 GPU available for use by Ray, you can do this with the flags `--num-cpus=10` and `--num-gpus=1`.\n\nSee the Configuration page for more information.",
