It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When Ray Serve scales down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that allows the Ray autoscaler to remove nodes with no Ray actors or tasks running on them.

It has a large and active community, and it integrates well with other big data tools such as Hadoop and Kafka.\n\nRay is a high-performance distributed execution engine that is designed to be general-purpose but with a focus on scaling machine learning and AI workloads. Ray provides a task-based programming model that allows users to parallelize and distribute their code easily, and it has built-in support for popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\nDask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing, built with the Python ecosystem in mind. It provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of NumPy and Pandas, allowing users to scale up their existing code with minimal changes. Dask can be used as a drop-in replacement for NumPy and Pandas, and it integrates well with other Python data science tools such as Scikit-learn and Jupyter notebooks.\n\nDask can be run on top of Ray, which provides a scheduler for Dask that allows users to build data analyses using Dask's collections and execute them on a Ray cluster. This combination allows users to take advantage of Ray's high-performance task execution engine while still using the familiar NumPy and Pandas APIs provided by Dask. However, Dask-on-Ray is not expected to achieve the same performance as using Ray directly.\n\nIn summary, Spark is a general-purpose cluster-computing system that integrates well with other big data tools, Ray is a high-performance distributed execution engine that is designed for scaling machine learning and AI workloads, and Dask is a flexible parallel computing library that provides big data collections for the Python ecosystem. Dask can be run on top of Ray to take advantage of Ray's high-performance task execution engine while still using the familiar NumPy and Pandas APIs provided by Dask.",

In the context you provided, it looks like the logs are being stored in `~/ray_results`. Therefore, you can start TensorBoard by running the command `tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results`.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that only the results from the rank 0 worker will be used for logging. To aggregate results from multiple workers, you can use Ray Train's `train.report()` function to report metrics from the training function on distributed workers. These results will be collected from the distributed workers and passed to the driver to be logged and displayed.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the training function to report metrics using Ray Train's `train.report()` function:\n\n```\nimport ray\n\ndef train_func():\n    # Initialize Ray Train\n    train = ray.train.Train()\n\n    batch_size = 64\n    single_worker_dataset = mnist_dataset(batch_size)\n    single_worker_model = build_and_compile_cnn_model()\n\n    for epoch in range(epochs):\n        tf_dataset = single_worker_dataset.to_tf(\n            feature_columns=\"x\", label_columns=\"y\", batch_size=batch_size\n        )\n\n        history = single_worker_model.fit(\n            tf_dataset, callbacks=[ReportCheckpointCallback()], epochs=3, steps_per_epoch=70\n        )\n\n        # Report metrics\n        train.report(metrics={\"loss\": history.history[\"loss\"][-1]})\n\n    return history.history\n```\n\nIn this example, the `train.report()` function is called after each epoch to report the loss metric. You can modify this function to report other metrics as well.\n\nFinally, to start TensorBoard and view the logs, run the command `tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results`.",

The `RunConfig` object is then created with the `SyncConfig` object and a storage path.\n\nNote that Ray AIR no longer supports the synchronization of checkpoints and other artifacts from worker nodes to the head node.

If you need to set the target size without running a Ray program, consider using the Ray cluster launcher or Kubernetes configuration to set the maximum number of worker nodes.",

Check if there are any pending tasks or actors that cannot be scheduled by running `ray status`. If there are, you may need to increase the number of available CPUs or GPUs in your Ray cluster.\n2. Use the `ray profiler` to identify any performance bottlenecks or resource contention issues.\n3. Check if any of your custom code or user-defined functions are causing the deadlock. You can use Python's built-in debugging tools such as `pdb` or `print` statements to inspect the state of your program at various points in time.\n4. If you are using Ray's `rollout_worker` module, make sure that you are creating and destroying workers correctly. You can refer to the `RolloutWorker` class documentation in the Ray RLlib library for more information on how to use this module.\n5. If none of the above steps help, you can try creating a minimal, reproducible example that demonstrates the deadlock and post it on the Ray community forum or GitHub repository for further assistance.",

Here's an example:\n```python\nstate_dict = model.state_dict()\ncheckpoint = TensorflowCheckpoint.from_state_dict(state_dict)\n```\nOnce you have created the checkpoint, you can save it to a directory using the `to_directory()` method.

            "answer": " In Ray Serve, a deployment is a group of actors that can handle traffic. It is a central concept and contains business logic or an ML model to handle incoming requests. A deployment consists of a number of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the incoming request load. You can define a deployment using the `@serve.deployment` decorator on a Python class or function.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\n@serve.deployment\nclass MyDeployment:\n    def __init__(self, name: str):\n        self._name = name\n\n    def __call__(self, request):\n        return \"Hello world!\"\n\napp = MyDeployment.bind()\nserve.run(app)\n```\nThis creates a deployment named \"MyDeployment\" with one replica. Requests to this deployment will call the `__call__` method on the class.\n\nYou can also configure a deployment to scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\nThe `Deployment.create` method creates a deployment object and `Deployment.deploy` deploys the object in the instance of Ray Serve with the specified number of replicas.\n\nFor example:\n```\ndeployment = Serve.deployment() \\\n    .setName(\"strategy\") \\\n    .setDeploymentDef(StrategyOnRayServe.class.getName()) \\\n    .setNumReplicas(4) \\\n    .create()\ndeployment.deploy(true)\n```\nThis creates a deployment named \"strategy\" with 4 replicas.\n\nYou can also deploy a Ray Serve application to production on a Ray cluster using the Ray Serve CLI. The `serve deploy` command takes in a config file path and deploys that file to a Ray cluster over HTTP. This can be done on a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.",

You can use it by updating the user\\_config when creating a deployment or by triggering the reconfigure method of the deployment.

Deploy the graph:\n```arduino\n$ ray start --head\n$ serve deploy fruit_config.yaml\n```\n2. Trigger the reconfigure method by updating the Serve config file with a new user\\_config:\n```yaml\n...\ndeployments:\n    - name: Model\n      user_config:\n        threshold: 1.5\n```\n3.

Instead, it would be more advisable to create 'key pools' where an actor can hold many keys, as demonstrated in Modin's implementation of XGBoost which spins up one actor for each node and aggregates all of the partitions on that node to the XGBoost Actor.

A singleton actor is a single instance of such an actor that can be accessed across different parts of the program.\n\nAdvantages of using a singleton actor include:\n\n* Centralized state management: A singleton actor can serve as a centralized place to manage and access shared state across different parts of the program.\n* Simplified concurrency: Since there is only one instance of the actor, there are no issues related to concurrent access to shared state.\n* Improved performance: Since the actor's state is maintained in memory, accessing it can be faster than querying a database or a file system.\n\nDisadvantages of using a singleton actor include:\n\n* Limited scalability: Since there is only one instance of the actor, it can become a bottleneck as the number of tasks or actors that need to access it increases.\n* Difficult to reason about: Since the actor can be accessed from different parts of the program, it can be difficult to reason about its behavior and debug issues related to it.\n* Violation of encapsulation: A singleton actor can lead to tight coupling between different parts of the program, making it difficult to modify or extend the program in the future.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to avoid anti-patterns such as closure capturing large objects and using global variables to share state between tasks and actors, as they can harm performance and lead to difficult-to-debug issues.",

Provides Get-Or-Create functionality for actor creation, where a handle to the actor will be returned if it already exists, and a new actor will be created with the specified arguments if it doesn't.\n4. Supports non-global named actors in C++, where the actor name is only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.\n5. Named actors are scoped by namespace, and if no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.\n\nIn summary, named actors provide a way to access and manage actors in a more flexible and decoupled manner within a Ray cluster.",

The `map_batches` method applies this function to each batch of data in the dataset, with a batch size of 5.

            "answer": " To set a maximum episode length when training with Rllib, you can use the `evaluation_duration` and `evaluation_duration_unit` configuration settings. However, these settings control the length of evaluation episodes and not training episodes.\n\nUnfortunately, RLlib does not directly support setting a maximum episode length for training episodes. Instead, you can implement this functionality in your custom environment by terminating the episode when the desired length is reached.\n\nHere's an example of how to terminate an episode in a custom OpenAI Gym environment:\n\n```python\nclass MyCustomEnv(gym.Env):\n    def __init__(self, max_episode_length):\n        self.max_episode_length = max_episode_length\n\n    def step(self, action):\n        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = super().step(action)\n        if truncated or terminated:\n            return observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info\n        if self.step_num >= self.max_episode_length:\n            terminated = True\n            reward = -10  # negative reward for terminating the episode early\n        self.step_num += 1\n        return observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info\n```\n\nIn this example, the `step_num` attribute keeps track of the current step number in the episode. When the step number reaches the `max_episode_length`, the `terminated` flag is set to `True`, and the episode is terminated. You can adjust the `reward` value to provide appropriate feedback to the agent for terminating the episode early.",

            "answer": " To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can configure the `FailureConfig` with appropriate settings. However, the provided context does not include information on how to set up `FailureConfig`. Instead, it suggests using the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` functions.\n\nThe `on_trial_error` function is called after a trial instance fails, while `on_trial_recover` is called after a trial instance fails but is scheduled for retry. You can define custom behavior in these functions to handle trial failures and retries.\n\nTo set up trial retries, you can use the following example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import tune\n\ndef on_trial_error(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    # Implement custom behavior for trial failure here\n    pass\n\ndef on_trial_recover(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    # Implement custom behavior for trial recovery here\n    pass\n\nray.tune.register_callback(on_trial_error)\nray.tune.register_callback(on_trial_recover)\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, callbacks=[on_trial_error, on_trial_recover])\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `on_trial_error` and `on_trial_recover` functions are registered as callbacks, and then passed to the `Tuner` constructor. This will ensure that the callbacks are invoked when a trial fails or is scheduled for retry. You can implement custom behavior for trial failure and recovery in these functions.\n\nHowever, if you want to configure trial retries using `FailureConfig`, you can refer to the Ray Tune documentation for more information on how to set it up.",

This is because of actor reference counting - when the supervisor dies, any worker actors it manages will be automatically terminated. This pattern is simplified in the driver, as it only has to manage a few supervisors and not deal with failures from worker actors directly. However, you can decouple actor lifetimes from the job, allowing an actor to persist even after the driver process of the job exits, by specifying the 'lifetime' as 'detached'.",

We then create a `Dataset` `ds` using `ray.data.range`, and apply the `map` function using our remote class as input. The `map` function will apply the `__call__` method of our class to each row in the dataset.\n\nThe output of the example will be the first 5 rows of the mapped dataset, with the `col1` values doubled and the `col2` values tripled.",

However, it's important to note that Ray automatically decides task parallelism based on resource availability. Therefore, it's recommended to adjust how many tasks can run concurrently by modifying each task\u2019s resource requirements instead.\n\nHere's an example of how to set 4 GB of memory limit for each trial:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune.resources import Resources\n\n# Set resource requirements for each trial\ntrain_model = tune.with_resources(train_model, Resources(memory=4000))\n```\n\nIn this example, `train_model` is the function or class representing your trial, and `Resources(memory=4000)` sets the memory limit to 4 GB for each trial.\n\nNote that the actual memory limit may depend on the total memory available in your cluster and the memory usage of other processes running on the same nodes.",

Here is an example:\n```python\nfrom ray.util.state import get_actor\n\nactor_state = get_actor(id=\"<ACTOR_ID>\")\nprint(actor_state)\n```\nReplace `<ACTOR_ID>` with the actual ID of the actor you want to get the state of.

This will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`. Note that Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\nIn this example, `blocking_operation()` is a Ray task that sleeps for a long time. `obj_ref` is the Object Ref returned by calling `blocking_operation.remote()`. To cancel the task, you can call `ray.cancel(obj_ref)`. If you want to check if the task was successfully cancelled, you can call `ray.get(obj_ref)` and catch the `TaskCancelledError` exception.",

Convert your training function to a distributed multi-worker training function using `ray.train.torch.prepare_model` and `ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader` utility functions.\n3. Set up your model and data for distributed training with DistributedDataParallel and DistributedSampler.\n4. Use `train.torch.prepare_data_loader` to load the data shard for each worker.\n5. Initialize Ray and set up Ray distributed actors.\n\nHere's an example of how to set up a distributed multi-worker training function with Keras:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray import train\nfrom ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\ndef train_func_distributed():\n    num_epochs = 3\n    batch_size = 64\n\n    dataset = get_dataset()\n    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)\n    dataloader = train.torch.prepare_data_loader(dataloader)\n\n    model = MyKerasModel()\n    model = train.torch.prepare_model(model)\n\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        for batch in dataloader:\n            # Perform training\n\ntrainer = TorchTrainer(\n    train_func_distributed,\n    scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=4, use_gpu=use_gpu)\n)\n\nresults = trainer.fit()\n```\n\nNote: This example assumes that you have a Keras model `MyKerasModel` and a dataset `get_dataset()` already defined. You will also need to install the Ray Train and TensorFlow packages:\n\n```bash\npip install -U \"ray[train]\" tensorflow\n```",

This will compute the entire preprocessed dataset and pin it in the Ray object store memory, avoiding re-running preprocessing operations when iterating over the dataset repeatedly.\n3. If you're working with tabular data, consider using Ray Data preprocessors, which implement common data preprocessing operations.\n4. For unstructured data, use Ray Data operations like `map_batches`.\n\nRemember that Ray Data is designed for deep learning applications that involve both CPU preprocessing and GPU inference, allowing you to utilize both sets of resources concurrently and reducing overall cost.\n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the Ray Data User Guides and the Ray Train User Guides.",

This is a known issue with certain versions of Python's pickle module. To resolve this issue, you can try upgrading to a later version of Python (3.8.2rc1 or 3.9.0 alpha 4 or later) where this issue has been fixed.\n\nAlternatively, you can convert the pickle checkpoint to a msgpack one using an RLlib utility function, as shown in the context. This may allow you to avoid the pickling issue altogether.\n\nFinally, if you need to use TLS with Ray, you can set the appropriate environment variables for both the Ray head and worker to enable TLS, as described in the context. However, this is unrelated to the pickling issue.",

            "answer": " It is not possible to pickle a variable defined in an actor's `__init__` method directly because each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, and they have their own copies of the class variables. However, you can pass the variable to the actor's method as an argument or use a class variable instead.\n\nIn the provided context, `global_var_actor` is passed as an argument to the actor's `__init__` method, and it is used in the actor's method `f`. This is a valid way to share state between actor instances.\n\nAlternatively, you can define a class variable and use it in the actor's methods. However, keep in mind that each actor instance will have its own copy of the class variable.\n\nHere's an example of using a class variable:\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    class_var = None\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def f(self):\n        return self.class_var + 3\n\nActor.class_var = 4\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.f.remote())  # returns 7\n```\nNote that using global variables to share state between tasks and actors is not recommended.

Create two actors `A` and `B` and create a collective group:\n```python\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\ncol = ray.util.collective.new_collective(\"default\", [A, B])\n```\n3. Invoke the `compute()` function on the actors to perform the allreduce operation:\n```python\nray.get([A.compute.remote(), B.compute.remote()])\n```\n\nNote that the `allreduce()` function can be used with any number of actors and can be used to reduce tensors on CPUs as well as GPUs.

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible to save resources.\n3. Be careful when running tests in parallel as Ray programs can be tricky to test.\n4. You can also create a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`.\n5. After each test, call `ray.shutdown()` to clean up resources.\n\nHere is an example test case:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Test your Ray code here\n        pass\n```\n\nYou can also run Tune tests by following the instructions in the context and using `pytest ray/python/ray/tune/tests/`.",

Note that you will need to replace `'3.8.11'` with the version of Python that you are using.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `--force-reinstall` option when installing the package with pip to force reinstall the package, even if it is already installed:\n```\nRuntimeEnv(\n    pip={\"packages\": [\"certifi==2022.2.1\"], \"pip_check\": False, \"pip_options\": [\"--force-reinstall\"]}\n)\n```\nThis will force reinstall the `certifi` package, even if it is already installed.\n\nKeep in mind that force upgrading a package can potentially lead to compatibility issues with other packages that depend on the older version of the package.

You can define async methods in Ray actors, and Ray will automatically detect whether an actor supports async calls or not. However, Ray does not support asyncio for remote tasks. Instead, you can wrap the async function with a synchronous wrapper to run the task. The `.remote()` postfix is used to run actor methods or tasks on a Ray cluster, and it is an asynchronous operation. `ray.put()` and `ray.get()` are used to store and retrieve objects from the object store, with `ray.put()` being a synchronous operation and `ray.get()` being a synchronous (i.e., blocking) operation.",

However, it's worth noting that actors are usually garbage collected automatically, and you can wait for the actor to exit by calling `ray.get()` on the ObjectRef resulting from the task.\n\n`ray.actor.exit_actor()` should only be used in special cases where an actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources, or for detached actors which must be manually destroyed.\n\nYou can also use `ray.kill(actor_handle)` to kill an actor forcefully, which will interrupt any running tasks on the actor and cause them to fail immediately. If you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead.\n\nNote that `ray.actor.exit_actor()` and `ray.kill()` will not go through the normal Python or C++ teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` or `std::atexit` will not be called.",

However, if you want to configure logging for your actor, you can use the `logging` module to customize the log messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can customize the prefixes for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class to replace the Actor name with a more descriptive identifier.

If you want to let pending tasks finish before killing the actor, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead.\n\nNote that if you only have one reference to an actor handle, calling `del actor` could trigger actor deletion. The actor will be terminated when all actor handles in Python are deleted, and garbage collection for actors has not been implemented yet.\n\nYou can also manually terminate an actor from within one of the actor methods by calling `ray.actor.exit_actor()`. This will kill the actor process and release resources associated with the actor. However, this approach should generally not be necessary as actors are automatically garbage collected.",

This means that the task will not reserve any CPU resources for its execution. However, it's important to note that if your tasks are very small or have variable durations, you might not see any speedup by increasing the number of CPUs.\n\nAdditionally, when specifying the number of CPUs or GPUs for a task or actor, you should be aware that the values must be supplied as strings. Also, the `num_cpus` field specifies the quantity of CPU resources to reserve for the task or actor, while the `num_gpus` field specifies the quantity of GPUs to reserve.\n\nFinally, the `entrypoint_num_cpus` field in `ray.job_submission.JobInfo` specifies the quantity of CPU cores to reserve for the entrypoint command of a Ray job.",

You can deploy a static Ray cluster to Kubernetes without using KubeRay, but it lacks the built-in autoscaling feature that KubeRay provides. However, you can enable Kubernetes autoscaling to fully utilize the resources in your cluster. For GKE, you can utilize the AutoPilot Kubernetes cluster, and for EKS, you can enable Kubernetes cluster autoscaling by utilizing the Cluster Autoscaler. The Ray autoscaler will work with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler. To enable Ray autoscaling in the KubeRay RayCluster custom resource (CR) config, you need to set `enableInTreeAutoscaling:true` and configure the `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` fields.",

For example, you can change the logging level to `logging.DEBUG` as follows:\n\n```\nimport logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"ray\")\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\nThis will change the logging level for all Ray loggers.

The cluster will immediately attempt to scale to accommodate the requested resources, bypassing normal upscaling speed constraints. This can be done by specifying the number of CPUs or a list of bundles as arguments to the function.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the Ray Cluster Management API to manage and configure Ray clusters. The API includes a CLI with commands such as `ray up` to create or update a Ray cluster, and `ray monitor` to monitor the cluster. The Python SDK API Reference and Ray Jobs CLI API Reference provide more details on these and other API commands.\n\nTo configure autoscaling for a Ray cluster, you can use the Ray cluster launcher to adjust the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The Ray autoscaler is a Ray cluster process that automatically scales a cluster up and down based on resource demand.",

Once the port forwarding is set up, you should be able to view the Ray Dashboard in your local browser at `localhost:8265`.\n\nIf the dashboard opens and then disappears, it may be due to an internal refresh failure.

It manages node membership and actor directory, and is critical for the functioning of the Ray cluster.\n\nThe reason why your GCS server might be taking up so much memory on the head node is because it stores all the data in-memory, and any failure means that the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required, which stores the data in Redis instance and allows the GCS to resume regular functions when it restarts.\n\nIf you want to run memory profiling on the GCS server, you can use Jemalloc and set the environment variables RAY\\_JEMALLOC\\_LIB\\_PATH and RAY\\_JEMALLOC\\_CONF.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and the driver runs from a head node by default. Therefore, it's recommended to specify --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node to prevent out-of-memory problems.",

Ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough and that there are no errors preventing the pods from reaching the \"Running\" state.\n3. If the head node is out of date or if there are not enough available resources in the cluster, consider terminating the out-of-date node and provisioning a new one, or adding more nodes to the cluster.\n4. If you're using Tune with Kubernetes, consider using shared storage for checkpoints to avoid additional synchronization across nodes.\n5. If you're using Ray Datasets, make sure that there are enough available CPUs in the cluster for the Dataset job to run.\n\nYou can also use the `wait_for_nodes` function to wait for all nodes to join the cluster before starting your application.

This enables local shuffling of data batches, improving performance as compared to global shuffling.\n\nExample:\n```python\nds = ray.data.read_text(\n    \"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt\"\n).randomize_block_order()\n\nfor batch in ds.iter_batches(batch_size=10000, local_shuffle_buffer_size=1000):\n    # Process batches here\n    pass\n```\nThis approach avoids the slow global shuffle while still providing randomness in data batches during the `map_batches()` operation.",

Check application-level failures by catching Python-level exceptions using try-except blocks in your code. Ray surfaces application-level failures as Python-level exceptions.\n2. Use Ray logging to understand system-level behavior and to surface application-level details during runtime. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session\\_latest/logs/serve/. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n3. Review the specific Ray exceptions provided in the context, such as `ObjectReconstructionFailedLineageEvictedError`, `RuntimeEnvSetupError`, and `CrossLanguageError`, which can give you more information about the type of failure that occurred.\n\nRemember to test your Ray Serve script locally or in a RayCluster before deploying it to a RayService to catch any script-related issues.",

This involves automatically dropping into the debugger when an exception is thrown. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. Install the required dependencies:\n```\npip install \"ray[serve]\" scikit-learn\n```\n2. Create a file called `serve_debugging.py` and include the following code:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray import serve\n\nserve.start()\n```\n\n3. Add a function that raises an exception.\n\n4. Run the Ray Serve application with the `--logging-level` flag set to `debug`:\n\n```bash\nray serve --logging-level debug serve_debugging.py\n```\n\n5. When an uncaught exception occurs, Ray Serve will print the traceback in the logs, allowing you to track and debug the issue.\n\nAdditionally, when a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a `RayTaskError`. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result. You can catch these exceptions in your application code to handle them appropriately.",

This can happen if the trainable function/class launches other actors or tasks that consume CPU/GPU resources. To reserve extra resource slots, you can use `tune.with_resources` with a `tune.PlacementGroupFactory` that specifies the required resources for each bundle. Additionally, if one process is using most of the CPUs and the others are using a small amount, this may also be the problem. It's also possible that Ray is not scheduling more tasks in parallel than the number of CPUs, or that there are not enough available CPUs for Ray Data to run on. You can limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the `max_concurrent_trials` Tune option to ensure there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on.",

Since you mentioned that Prometheus and Grafana are not running on your Head node and you are using KubeRay, you should set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the address that the head node can use to access Prometheus on your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nRegarding the IP address of the head node changing every time you reconfigure your cluster, you can set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to the external URL of the Grafana ingress, which should remain constant even if the head node IP changes. Similarly, you can set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the service URL of Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster, which should also remain constant regardless of the head node IP.\n\nTherefore, you should set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to the external URL of the Grafana ingress and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the service URL of Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster.

The Ray autoscaler, which is a Ray cluster process running as a sidecar container in the Ray head pod, adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on these resource demands. When the Ray autoscaler decides to delete an idle pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can clean up the idle Kubernetes node that remains.

Install miniforge.\n2. Ensure you're using the miniforge environment.\n3. Install Ray as you normally would using pip.\n\nHowever, note that the function `use_gpu()` defined above doesn't actually use any GPUs. To use GPUs, you need to install the GPU version of TensorFlow and modify the function to use TensorFlow's GPU capabilities.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    if tf.test.gpu_device_name():\n        print('Default GPU Device: {}'.format(tf.test.gpu_device_name()))\n    else:\n        print(\"Please install GPU version of TF\")\n```\n\nTo avoid bottlenecks and develop and test Tune locally, you can configure search spaces, use large datasets, and continue training a completed Tune experiment for longer and with new configurations. You can also use multi-tenancy to run multiple Ray Tune jobs on the same cluster at the same time.\n\nTo make your Tune experiments reproducible, you can set the random seed and use the same version of dependencies. To upload your Tune results to cloud storage, you can use the `ray.tune.report()` function to log results and use a Ray Serve or a custom HTTP server to retrieve the results.\n\nTo use Tune with Docker or Kubernetes, you can follow the Ray documentation to set up a Ray cluster and use Tune with Docker or Kubernetes.\n\nTo access relative filepaths in your Tune training function, you can use the `os.path.join()` function to combine the relative path with the current working directory.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, you can refer to the Ray documentation or ask for help on the Ray community Slack channel.",

This allows you to dynamically specify environment variables, packages, local files, and more.\n\nFor example:\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"/path/to/working/dir\"})\n```\nNote that the session name will still include a timestamp and the process ID by default, but you can use the `namespace` and `runtime_env` arguments to customize other aspects of the session.",

In this example, we use a local Ray cluster, but you can replace the address with the address of a remote Ray cluster.",
