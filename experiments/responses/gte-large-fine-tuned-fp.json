Instead, you can use `map_batches()` for better performance, especially if your transformation is vectorized.\n\nIn your case, since you're struggling with type conversions during `map_batches`, you can use the `convert_batches()` function to convert data types in your batches. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ndef convert_batch_types(batch: Any) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    # Perform type conversions here\n    return batch\n\nds = ds.map_batches(convert_batch_types, batch_format=\"pandas\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `convert_batch_types` is a function that takes a batch and returns a converted batch with the desired data types. The `batch_format` parameter is set to \"pandas\" to ensure that the input batch is a pandas DataFrame.\n\nFor more advanced use cases, you can also use Ray's built-in preprocessors, which are designed to perform common data preprocessing operations. These preprocessors can be applied using the `map_batches()` function as well.",

This is because `ray.get()` is a synchronous operation, which means it will block the program until the result is available. However, this can hurt parallelism as it prevents the driver program from invoking other operations. To avoid this, you can separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions, so that all remote functions are spawned before waiting for the results. This way, they can run in parallel in the background. Additionally, you can pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` instead of calling it one by one to wait for all tasks to finish.

If you want to aggregate results from multiple workers, you'll need to handle that separately.\n\nRegarding the logs from distributed workers, by default, Worker stdout and stderr for Tasks and Actors stream to the Ray Driver, which helps aggregate the logs for the distributed Ray application in a single place. You can customize the worker loggers for individual worker processes when defining Tasks or Actors using the `logging` module.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the logs from the Driver are not accessible from the Dashboard if you execute the Driver directly on the Head Node of the Ray Cluster or run with Ray Client. In this case, you can view the Driver logs in the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output. Task and Actor logs (Worker logs) are accessible from the Task and Actor table view in the Ray Dashboard by clicking the \u201cLog\u201d button.",

Instead, `SyncConfig` is typically configured within your Ray AIR training script.\n\nHere's a brief example of how to use `SyncConfig` in a Ray AIR training script:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import air, tune\n\n# Define your training function\ndef train_func(config):\n    # Your training code here\n    pass\n\n# Initialize Ray with a specific address and namespace\nray.init(address=\"auto\", namespace=\"my_namespace\")\n\n# Create a Ray AIR Trainer with SyncConfig\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    train_func,\n    param_space={\n        # Your parameter space here\n    },\n    run_config=air.RunConfig(\n        sync_config=air.SyncConfig(\n            upload_partitions=\"eager\"  # You can configure eager or lazy upload here\n        )\n    ),\n)\n\n# Run the training with Ray AIR\nresult = tuner.fit()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SyncConfig` is configured within the `run_config` argument of the `tune.Tuner` constructor. You can adjust the `upload_partitions` parameter to either \"eager\" or \"lazy\" based on your use case.\n\nFor RayJob configuration, follow the instructions provided in the context:\n\n1. Download the RayJob configuration file:\n\n```bash\ncurl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/kuberay/master/ray-operator/config/samples/ray_v1alpha1_rayjob.yaml\n```\n\n2. Create a RayJob:\n\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f ray_v1alpha1_rayjob.yaml\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the number of workers in the RayJob configuration, as mentioned in the context.

This function commands the autoscaler to scale the cluster up to the desired size, bypassing normal upscaling speed constraints.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a way to set a target size for a non-autoscaling cluster, you can use the Ray cluster launcher to create a fixed-size cluster. You can specify the number of CPUs and GPUs for the head node and worker types in a YAML configuration file, similar to the example provided for the fake_multi_node cluster. When starting the cluster, you can use the `--num-workers` flag to set the number of worker nodes in the cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a fixed-size cluster with 2 worker nodes:\n\n1.

However, the issue of Ray rollout workers deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py` is not directly related to the Ray Jobs API.\n\nTo debug this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the Ray version and Python version you are using, as compatibility issues between Ray and Python versions can cause problems.\n2. Use the Ray Core API to initialize Ray with the desired runtime environment, including the `worker_process_setup_hook` to apply the new logging configuration to all worker processes within a job.\n3. Check the Ray cluster resources and dashboard to ensure that the cluster has enough resources to run the job.\n4. Refer to the documentation for any Ray libraries you are using, as there may be specific instructions or requirements for using them with Ray.\n5. If the issue persists, you can try debugging the Ray rollout workers by checking the Ray logs and using a debugger to step through the code.\n\nHere is an example of initializing Ray with the desired runtime environment and `worker_process_setup_hook`:\n```python\nimport logging\nimport ray\n\ndef logging_setup_func():\n    logger = logging.getLogger(\"ray\")\n    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"always\")\n\nray.init(runtime_env={\"worker_process_setup_hook\": logging_setup_func})\nlogging_setup_func()\n```\nRefer to the Ray Core API documentation for more information on initializing Ray and using the runtime environment.",

It allows you to customize various aspects of the deployment, such as the number of replicas to use, the amount of CPU and memory to allocate to each replica, and so on.\n\nTo use user config in Ray Serve, you can specify the `config` argument when creating a deployment using the `serve.deploy` function. For example:\n```\nserve.deploy(my_application, route_prefix=\"/myapp\", config={\n    \"num_replicas\": 4,\n    \"max_batch_size\": 32,\n    \"resources\": {\"CPU\": 1, \"GPU\": 0.5}\n})\n```\nThis will create a deployment of the `my_application` function with 4 replicas, each of which is allocated 1 CPU and 0.5 GPUs, and has a maximum batch size of 32.\n\nYou can find more information about the available configuration options in the [Ray Serve documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/user-config.html).",

Before running Ray at a large scale, make sure to configure the system by setting `ulimit -n` to at least 65535 and ensuring that `/dev/shm` is sufficiently large. When using Ray AIR with \ud83e\udd17 Transformers, initialize the model, metric, and tokenizer inside a function and return it. Ray will checkpoint the model at every epoch, allowing you to push it to the hub manually.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Install Ray on all machines.\n2. Set up system configurations (`ulimit -n` and `/dev/shm`).\n3. For each user, start a Ray cluster:\n   a. Create a function for the \ud83e\udd17 Transformers Trainer.\n   b.

This can be useful in situations where you have large numpy arrays and want to avoid copying them unnecessarily.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\n# Create a large numpy array\narr = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)\n\n# Put the numpy array in the object store\narr_id = ray.put(arr)\n\n# Get the numpy array from the object store\narr_copy = ray.get(arr_id)\n```\n\nNote that this feature is not specific to the NevergradSearch or Tune APIs, but can be used in conjunction with them.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that while the 'zero-copy' feature can help avoid unnecessary data copies, it still has some overhead associated with serialization and deserialization, so it may not always result in a performance improvement.

Unique identification: Actors can be given a unique name within their namespace, allowing you to retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Accessibility: You can access a named actor launched by another driver or when you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it.\n3. Garbage collection: The actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist, ensuring resource efficiency.\n4. Get-or-create functionality: Ray provides a `get_if_exists` option for actor creation, which creates an actor only if it doesn\u2019t exist, simplifying common use cases.\n5.

The `complete_episodes` batching mode in Rllib ensures that each call to `EnvRunner.sample()` will return a batch of at least `rollout_fragment_length * num_envs_per_worker` in size, and episodes will not be truncated. Instead, multiple episodes may be packed within one batch to meet the (minimum) batch size.\n\nTherefore, if you want to limit the maximum episode length, you can modify your environment to terminate episodes that exceed the desired length.

This behavior is independent of whether the actor is passed to another actor or not. To allow an actor to persist even after the driver process of the job exits, you can create a detached actor.",

            "answer": " To read a large text file in S3 with Ray, you can use the `ray.data.read_text` function and provide the S3 path to the text file as an argument. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\npath = \"s3://bucket/path/to/textfile.txt\"\nds = ray.data.read_text(path)\n```\nThis will create a Ray Dataset `ds` that contains the text of the file. Note that this function assumes that the file is encoded in UTF-8. If your file uses a different encoding, you can specify the encoding as a second argument to `read_text`.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that if the text file is very large, reading it into memory all at once may not be feasible. In that case, you can use the `block` method to read the file in chunks, like this:\n```python\nblock_size = 1024 * 1024 * 100  # Read the file in 100 MB chunks\nds = ray.data.read_text(path, block_size=block_size)\n```\nThis will create a Ray Dataset `ds` that contains the text of the file in 100 MB blocks, which you can then process one block at a time.",

However, Ray does not directly support setting a memory limit for each trial. Instead, you can set a limit on the total amount of memory that can be used by all trials running on a single Ray worker by configuring the Ray resource pool.\n\nHere's an example of how to set a memory limit of 4GB for each Ray worker:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray with a custom resource configuration\nray.init(\n    _system_config={\n        \"raylet__object_store_memory\": 4 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,  # 4GB memory limit\n    }\n)\n\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    my_trainable,\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(stop={\"training_iteration\": 10, \"mean_accuracy\": 0.8}),\n)\nresult_grid = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `raylet__object_store_memory` configuration option is used to set a 4GB memory limit for each Ray worker. Note that this will limit the total amount of memory that can be used by all trials running on a single Ray worker, so you may need to adjust the number of Ray workers or the memory limit based on the resource requirements of your trials.",

Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.runtime_context import RuntimeContext\n\ncurrent_actor_id = RuntimeContext.get_actor_id()\nprint(current_actor_id)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `actor_id` property from the `ray.runtime_context.RuntimeContext` class, which has the same functionality as `get_actor_id()`.\n\nNote that the `actor_id` property is deprecated and may be removed in future Ray releases, so it is recommended to use `get_actor_id()` instead.\n\nIf you want to get the state of an actor by its ID, you can use the `get_actor()` function from the `ray.util.state` module. This function returns the state of the actor with the given ID, or `None` if the actor is not found. Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_actor\n\nactor_state = get_actor(id=\"<ACTOR_ID>\")\nprint(actor_state)\n```\nYou can also use the `ray` CLI to get the state of an actor by its ID. For example:\n```\nray get actors <ACTOR_ID>\n```\nThis will print the state of the actor with the given ID.\n\nFinally, if you want to get the logs of an actor, you can use the `get_log()` function from the `ray.util.state` module. This function returns the logs of the actor with the given ID as an iterator of strings. Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\nfor line in get_log(actor_id=\"<ACTOR_ID>\"):\n    print(line)\n```\nYou can also use the `ray` CLI to get the logs of an actor.

This will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`. Note that Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\nIf the task is an async actor task, Ray will seek to cancel the associated `asyncio.Task`. The semantic of cancellation is equivalent to `asyncio`'s cancellation. If the task has finished, nothing happens. Only `force=False` is allowed for an actor task. Otherwise, it raises `ValueError`. Use `ray.kill(actor)` instead to kill an actor.\n\nRay attempts to cancel tasks on a best-effort basis, meaning cancellation is not always guaranteed. You can check if a task was successfully cancelled using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`. When the `recursive=True` argument is given, Ray cancels all child and actor tasks.",

Use the `ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer` class to train your model in a distributed manner.\n\nHere is some sample code to get you started:\n\n    from ray import train\n    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer\n\n    # Define your Keras model\n    from tensorflow import keras\n    model = keras.models.Sequential([\n        keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),\n        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n    ])\n\n    # Define your custom training function\n    def train_func(config):\n        # Assuming `ds` is your Ray Dataset\n        for batch in ds.iter_batches(batch_size=config['batch_size']):\n            # Perform training steps using your Keras model\n            model.train_on_batch(batch['x'], batch['y'])\n\n    # Define the training configuration\n    trainer_config = {\n        'scale_number_of_workers': num_workers,\n        'num_workers': num_workers,\n        'use_gpu': use_gpu,\n        'trainer_class': TorchTrainer,\n        'train_loop_per_worker': train_func,\n        'config': {\n            'batch_size': 32,\n            'model': model,\n            'ds': ds\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Train the model\n    result = train.run(trainer_config)\n\nNote that this is just a basic example, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you may need to install the necessary Ray and Keras libraries in your Databricks environment.",

            "answer": " To use `ray.put` and `ray.get`, you need to understand that they are used to store and retrieve objects in Ray's object store.\n\n`ray.put(value)` is used to store an object in the object store and returns an object reference, which can be used to pass the object as an argument to any remote function or method call. It is a synchronous operation.\n\n`ray.get(object_refs)` is used to return an object or list of objects from the object ID or list of object IDs. It is a synchronous (i.e., blocking) operation.\n\nHere's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Put an object in the object store\nobj_ref = ray.put(\"hello world\")\n\n# Get the object from the object store\nobj = ray.get(obj_ref)\n\n# Print the object\nprint(obj)\n```\nIn this example, we first initialize Ray using `ray.init()`. Then, we use `ray.put()` to store the string \"hello world\" in the object store and get an object reference. Finally, we use `ray.get()` to retrieve the object from the object store and print it.\n\nNote that it's best practice to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()` and to work with object references directly, as calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily can harm performance.",

First, you need to get a reference to the actor object that you want to pickle. You can do this by calling the `ray.remote.get_actor` function with the actor ID as an argument.\n2. Once you have a reference to the actor object, you can access the variable that you want to pickle. For example, if you have an actor class `MyActor` with an `index` variable defined in the `__init__` method, you can access this variable using the `actor.index` syntax.\n3. Now that you have access to the variable you want to pickle, you can use the `pickle` module to serialize it. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport pickle\n\n# Get a reference to the actor object\nactor = ray.remote.get_actor(actor_id)\n\n# Access the variable you want to pickle\nmy_variable = actor.my_variable\n\n# Serialize the variable using pickle\npickled_variable = pickle.dumps(my_variable)\n```\nNote that pickling an actor object or its variables may not be a common use case, as actors are designed to be stateful and persistent objects that can be accessed remotely.

This will interrupt any running tasks on the actor and cause them to fail immediately. If you want to let pending tasks finish before killing the actor, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. After calling `ray.kill(actor)`, the actor's name may be reused.\n\nIf you want to see the death cause of a dead actor, you can use the `ray list actors --detail` command from the Ray State API. This will show you the death cause of dead actors, including any error messages that were raised.\n\nIt's important to note that detached actors are not automatically garbage-collected by Ray, so they must be manually destroyed once you are sure that they are no longer needed. To do this, use `ray.kill` to manually terminate the actor.\n\nIn C++, customizing the lifetime of an actor has not been implemented yet. To destroy a detached actor in C++, you can use `actor_handle.Kill()`. This will immediately exit the actor's process, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a `RayActorError`. If you would like Ray to automatically restart the actor, make sure to set a nonzero `max_restarts` in the `@ray.remote` options for the actor, then pass the flag `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill()`.",

Note that this is just one way to enable debug logs in Ray, and the exact method may vary depending on your specific use case and Ray components involved.\n\nAdditionally, you can use Ray's structured logging to simplify log processing and parsing. Ray logs can be found in the `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` directory, and can be parsed with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki. Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data, so users need to manage the lifecycle of the logs by themselves.",

            "answer": " If you set `num_cpus=0` for tasks, it will not reserve any CPUs for those tasks. However, this does not force GPU tasks to release resources after finishing. To achieve that, you can use the `cancel()` function to cancel pending or running tasks.\n\nRegarding the `max_retries` and `max_task_retries` configuration, they are used to specify the maximum number of times that a task should be retried if it fails due to a system error. A value of -1 indicates that the task should be retried indefinitely.\n\nThe `Task` function allows you to cancel a task that is pending execution or currently executing. If the task is currently executing, the behavior depends on the `force` flag. When `force=False`, a `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in Python, and when `force=True`, the executing task immediately exits. If the task is already finished, nothing happens.\n\nIt's important to note that cancelled tasks aren't retried, and `max_task_retries` aren't respected. Calling `ray.get()` on a cancelled task raises a `TaskCancelledError` if the task has been scheduled or interrupted. It raises a `WorkerCrashedError` if `force=True`. If `recursive=True`, all child tasks and actor tasks are cancelled. If `force=True` and `recursive=True`, `force=True` is ignored for child actor tasks.",

To use a callback in a Trainer, you would typically define the callback function and then pass it as an argument to the Trainer when you initialize it.\n\nHere's an example of how you might define a callback function and use it in a PyTorch Trainer:\n\n```python\ndef my_callback(trainer, epoch):\n    # Do something at the end of each epoch\n    print(f\"Epoch {epoch} complete\")\n\ntrainer = Trainer(model=my_model, train_dataloader=train_dataloader, callbacks=[my_callback])\ntrainer.train()\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_callback` is a function that takes two arguments: the Trainer object and the current epoch number. The callback function is then passed as an argument to the Trainer when it is initialized.\n\nThe specifics of how to use a callback in a Trainer will depend on the specific machine learning framework and Trainer class you are using.",

However, it is possible that the logs are not being displayed if the logging level is set too high (e.g., `logging.WARNING` or `logging.ERROR`) in your code or in the Ray logger configuration.\n\nTo modify the Ray logger, you can use the `logging` module in Python. Here's an example of how to set the logging level to `logging.DEBUG`:\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"ray\")\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\nThis will ensure that all logs with a level of `logging.DEBUG` or higher will be displayed in the Ray logs.\n\nAdditionally, if you are running the Ray job using the Job API, you can check the Dashboard for the job logs, which follow the format `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`. If you are running the Ray job directly on the head node or with Ray Client, you can check the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output for the driver logs.\n\nTask and actor logs are accessible from the Task and Actor table view in the Ray Dashboard, and can be accessed by clicking the \"Log\" button.

This will bypass normal upscaling speed constraints and immediately attempt to scale the cluster to accommodate the requested resources. For example:\n\n`ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=100)`\n\nThis will request 100 CPUs from the autoscaler, which will immediately attempt to scale the cluster to accommodate this request.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Ray Cluster Management API and Configuring Autoscaling sections in the provided context.",

It may be taking up a lot of memory on the head node due to the large number of worker nodes connecting to it, which can cause the ARP cache to overflow. To prevent this, you can increase the ARP cache size in the head node's configuration. The autoscaler only considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization, so if there are insufficient resources, the request will be queued and the autoscaler will add nodes to satisfy the demand. If the head node has insufficient resources, Ray may kill the most recently scheduled task. To alleviate this, you can adjust the minimum and maximum number of worker nodes and their resource configurations.",

Check the detailed cluster status with `ray status`. This command will show you the status of each node in the cluster.\n2. If you see any errors or warnings in the output of `ray status`, investigate them further. For example, if a node is stuck in the \"Pending\" state, you can check the status of the corresponding Kubernetes pod with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.\n3. If the pod is stuck in the \"Pending\" state, there might be an issue with the Docker resource limits. You can check the events of the pod with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n4. If the pod is running but the Ray node is not ready, you can check the logs of the Ray node with `ray logs <node-id>`. This might give you more information about the issue.\n5. If you still cannot figure out the issue, you can try restarting the cluster with `ray up`. This will restart all Ray services and reapply the filemounts and setup commands.\n6.

The dashboard provides a high-level overview of the system and can help you identify any potential issues.\n3. Leverage Ray logging to understand system-level behavior and surface application-level details during runtime. Ray Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\", and logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node.\n4. For production deployments, consider exporting logs and metrics to your observability platforms for further analysis and monitoring.\n\nRefer to the Ray logging, Monitor Ray Serve, and User Guides documentation for more information on how to configure logging, monitor your application, and troubleshoot issues.",

Here's an example of how to use the Ray Client to track uncaught exceptions:\n\n1. Initialize Ray: `ray.init()`\n2. Create a Ray Serve application.\n3. Use the Ray Client to track uncaught exceptions:\n```python\nfrom ray import serve\n\n@serve.deployment\nclass MyApp:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.counter = 0\n\n    async def handle_request(self, request):\n        try:\n            # Handle the request\n            self.counter += 1\n            if self.counter > 5:\n                raise Exception(\"Counter exceeded 5\")\n            return {\"result\": self.counter}\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Report the exception to the Ray Client\n            serve.get_runtime_context().report_exception(e)\n            return {\"error\": str(e)}\n\n# Deploy the application\nMyApp.deploy()\n```\nIn this example, if an exception is raised during the handling of a request, the `report_exception()` method is called to report the exception to the Ray Client. The Ray Client can then be used to track and handle uncaught exceptions in your Ray Serve applications.\n\nNote: Ray Serve is a scalable model serving library for building online inference APIs, and it is framework-agnostic, meaning that it can be used to serve models built with various machine learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn. It is also not tied to any specific cloud provider, making it a flexible solution for serving machine learning models in a multi-cloud world.",

Load the checkpoints into your model for test inference or further analysis.\n\nSince you used cloud checkpointing, you may need to download the checkpoints from the cloud to your local machine before loading them into your model. The method to download the checkpoints depends on the cloud storage system you used.\n\nFor example, if you used S3, you can use the `boto3` library to download the checkpoints:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ns3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\nfor checkpoint in checkpoints:\n    trial_name = checkpoint['trial_name']\n    checkpoint_path = checkpoint['checkpoint_path']\n    local_path = f\"/local/path/{trial_name}/{checkpoint_path}\"\n    s3.download_file(\"my-log-dir\", checkpoint_path, local_path)\n```\n\nReplace `\"my-log-dir\"` with your S3 bucket name and `\"/local/path/\"` with the local directory where you want to save the checkpoints.",

To check if a task was successfully canceled, you can use `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`.\n\nIf you need to handle misbehaving tasks that are hanging, you can call `ray.cancel` on an ObjectRef returned by the task.

If you have a running Ray cluster, Ray Client server should be running on port 10001 of the head node by default. If not, you can create a Ray cluster by running `ray start --head` on the head node and `ray start` on other worker nodes.\n2. Use the Ray cluster launcher to start a cluster on the cloud. You can use the Ray CLI to launch the cluster with a configuration file (e.g. `config.yaml`) by running `ray up -y config.yaml`.\n3. Start the head node by running `ray start --head --port=6379` on the head node.\n4. Run Ray code by connecting to the Ray cluster with `ray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:10001\")` and then use Ray like you normally would.\n\nNote: You'll need to replace `<head_node_host>` with the actual hostname or IP address of the head node.",

One way to do this is to use a DNS service that assigns stable hostnames to the nodes running Prometheus and Grafana, and then set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` and `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to those hostnames.\n\nAlternatively, you could write a script that queries the Kubernetes API to find the IP addresses of the nodes running Prometheus and Grafana, and then sets `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` and `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` accordingly.\n\nRegarding the difference between `RAY_ADDRESS` and `--node-ip-address`, `RAY_ADDRESS` is used to specify the address of the Ray cluster to connect to, while `--node-ip-address` is used to specify the externally-available address of the head node so worker nodes can connect. If you are running Prometheus and Grafana on separate nodes, you would set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` and `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to the addresses of those nodes, while `RAY_ADDRESS` would be set to the address of the Ray cluster (which may be different from the address of the head node).",

By default, the number of GPUs is set based on detected GPUs, so as long as Ray can detect your M1 laptop's GPU, it should be available for use. Here's how to install Ray and start a local instance with the correct GPU configuration:\n\n1. Install miniforge for Apple Silicon as described in the first block of text you provided.\n2. Activate the miniforge environment by running `source ~/.bash_profile` and `conda activate`.\n3. Install Ray using pip as described in the second block of text you provided: `pip install ray`.\n4. When starting a Ray instance, specify the number of GPUs you want to assign to each raylet. For example, to assign one GPU, you can run:\n```css\nimport ray\nray.init(num_gpus=1)\n```\nThis will start a new local Ray instance with one GPU assigned to each raylet.",

However, an actor's state can become 'RESTARTING' or 'DEAD' due to fault tolerance issues, such as the actor process dying or the owner of the actor (the worker that originally created the actor) dying. Additionally, if an actor is detached, it doesn't have an owner process and is cleaned up when the Ray cluster is destroyed. It's important to note that using global variables to share state between tasks and actors is discouraged, and it's recommended to encapsulate global variables in an actor and pass the actor handle to other tasks and actors instead.",

However, it does provide some relevant information:\n\n1. The Ray documentation is built using the Sphinx build system and supports executable formats like Jupyter Notebooks. This suggests that you might find examples in the Ray documentation's source code, which is likely hosted in a public repository.\n\n2. The context emphasizes the importance of code snippets in documentation.

The context also mentions that users should be able to copy and adapt the examples. This suggests that the examples, if they exist, should be self-contained and runnable.\n\nGiven this information, I would recommend looking through the Ray documentation, particularly in the user guides and tutorials, for examples of RayJob with Kuberay.

You can do this by setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (if necessary) environment variables, or by creating a configuration file at `~/.aws/credentials`. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration).\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
