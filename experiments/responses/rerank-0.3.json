Dynamic request batching is another Ray Serve feature that improves service throughput without sacrificing latency.

It's designed for low-latency data processing and supports a wide range of tasks such as batch processing, interactive queries, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.\n\nRay is a high-performance distributed execution engine that can scale to thousands of nodes and supports a variety of use cases, including machine learning, reinforcement learning, and general distributed computing tasks. Ray's core abstraction is the \"actor,\" which is an object that can perform computations and maintain state. Ray also provides a task-based API that allows users to parallelize and distribute workloads across a cluster.\n\nDask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing, built with the Python ecosystem in mind. It provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of NumPy and Pandas, allowing those abstractions to represent larger-than-memory data and/or allowing operations on that data to be run on a multi-machine cluster. Dask is designed to integrate well with existing Python libraries and tools, and can be used to scale up existing Python codebases.\n\nDask can be used on top of Ray as a scheduler, which allows you to build data analyses using Dask's collections and execute them on a fast, fault-tolerant distributed task execution system geared towards production, like Ray. However, Dask-on-Ray is an ongoing project and is not expected to achieve the same performance as using Ray directly.\n\nRay Data handles many of the same batch processing workloads as Apache Spark, but with a streaming paradigm that is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference.\n\nIn summary, Spark is a general-purpose distributed computing system, Ray is a high-performance distributed execution engine, and Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing in Python. Dask can be used on top of Ray to provide a more user-friendly API for distributed computing in Python. Ray Data provides a streaming paradigm for batch processing workloads, which is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference.",

If a node has more tasks than its resources allow, it could lead to issues like overloading and out-of-memory errors. To prevent this, you can reduce the number of concurrently running tasks or increase the resources available on the node. Ray allows you to specify a task's logical resource requirements, and it will only run on a node if there are enough required logical resources available.

These components may take a few seconds to start up after the head Pod is ready. If you continue to encounter this issue after waiting for 1 minute, it's possible that the dashboard or dashboard agent may have failed to start.\n\nTo connect to a remote Ray cluster, you should use `ray.init(address=\"ray://<head_node_ip_address>:10001\")` with the appropriate IP address. Make sure your remote cluster has a similar environment to your local machine, including files, environment variables, and Python packages.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the Ray Dashboard is running by executing `ray dashboard cluster.yaml` in a separate shell. This command will forward the remote port 8265 to port 8265 on localhost.\n\nIf you still face issues, check if the Ray Cluster is running and accessible using its default HTTP address (http://127.0.0.1:8265 or ray://<head_node_ip_address>:10001).",

Additionally, Ray's memory monitor periodically prints the aggregated out-of-memory killer summary to Ray drivers.\n\nTo debug the issue, you can:\n\n1. Check the memory usage on the nodes using `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node_ip>` as suggested in the logs.\n2. Enable the appropriate CPU instructions in TensorFlow by rebuilding it with the appropriate compiler flags.\n3. Monitor the logs for OOM warnings and errors.\n4. Consider adjusting the batch size, learning rate, or other hyperparameters to reduce memory usage.\n5.

A Dataset can operate over a sequence of Ray object references to blocks.\n\nOn the other hand, a batch is a collection of data from multiple rows within a single block. Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays by default. You can inspect batches by calling Dataset.take\\_batch() and specify the batch\\_size and batch\\_format.\n\nIn summary, blocks are a higher-level organizational concept for data in Ray Datasets, while batches are a way to group data from multiple rows within a single block.",

It can be updated using the `reconfigure()` method or by modifying the Serve config file and reapplying it to the Ray cluster. The `serve config` command can be used to get the latest config file that the Ray Cluster received.\n\nTo use user config, you can define it in the Serve config file or on the `@serve.deployment` decorator. For example, you can set the `num_replicas`, `route_prefix`, and other parameters in the user config.\n\nHere's an example of how to use user config in a Ray cluster:\n\n1. Define the user config in the Serve config file (e.g., `fruit_config.yaml`):\n```yaml\ndeployments:\n  - name: Model\n    user_config:\n        threshold: 1.5\n```\n2. Start a Ray cluster locally:\n```\n$ ray start --head\n```\n3. Deploy the `fruit_config.yaml` file to the local Ray cluster:\n```\n$ serve deploy fruit_config.yaml\n```\n4. Update the user config by modifying the Serve config file and reapplying it to the Ray cluster:\n```python\n# Modify the user_config in the Serve config file\n$ edit fruit_config.yaml\n\n# Reapply the updated config to the Ray cluster\n$ serve deploy fruit_config.yaml\n```\n5. You can also update the user config dynamically using the `reconfigure()` method:\n```python\nfrom ray import serve\n\n@serve.deployment(name=\"Model\")\nclass Model:\n    def __init__(self, threshold=1.5):\n        self.threshold = threshold\n\n    def reconfigure(self, config):\n        self.threshold = config[\"threshold\"]\n\n# Deploy the Model deployment with a user_config\nserve.deploy(Model, user_config={\"threshold\": 2.0})\n\n# Update the user_config dynamically\nserve.set_deployment_config(\"Model\", {\"threshold\": 2.5})\n```\n\nNote that the `serve config` command can be used to get the latest config file that the Ray Cluster received, which represents the Serve application's goal state.",

This is because if the supervisor dies, or the driver, the worker actors are automatically terminated thanks to actor reference counting. This is true even if the worker actors are passed as references to other actors. However, you can make the actor's lifetime \"detached\" so that it survives after the driver process exits, allowing it to persist even after the original driver is terminated.",

However, Ray Tune does not directly support setting a memory limit for each trial. Instead, you can request a certain amount of memory from the Ray cluster when starting it, and then request a fraction of that memory for each trial.\n\nHere's an example of how to set 4GB of memory for each trial:\n\n1. Start the Ray cluster with 8GB of memory per worker:\n```python\nray start --memory 8G\n```\n2. Configure the trial to request 4GB of memory:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune.resources import Resources\n\n# Request 4GB of memory for each trial\ntrial_resources = Resources(memory=4*1024**3)\n\ntrain_model = tune.with_resources(train_model, trial_resources)\n```\n\nNote that this will only work if your cluster has enough memory to allocate 4GB per trial. Also, keep in mind that each Ray worker (and thus each Ray Tune Trial) will only be scheduled on one machine, so you will have to make sure that your Ray cluster has enough resources to schedule all the trials you want to run concurrently.",

These methods will return the ID of the actor in the current process in hex format.\n\nAlternatively, if you have given your actor a unique name, you can use the `ray.get_actor()` function to retrieve the actor by its name. This can be useful if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it, or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver.\n\nHere is an example of how to create and retrieve a named actor:\n\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter:\n    pass\n\n# Create an actor with a name\ncounter = Counter.options(name=\"some_name\").remote()\n\n# Retrieve the actor later somewhere\ncounter = ray.get_actor(\"some_name\")\n```\n\nTo see the death cause of dead actors, you can use the `ray list actors --detail` command from the Ray State API. This will show you information about the actors in the cluster, including their death cause if they have exited.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nray list actors --detail\n---\n-   actor_id: e8702085880657b355bf7ef001000000\n    class_name: Actor\n    state: DEAD\n    job_id: '01000000'\n    name: ''\n    node_id: null\n    pid: 0\n    ray_namespace: dbab546b-7ce5-4cbb-96f1-d0f64588ae60\n    serialized_runtime_env: '{}'\n    required_resources: {}\n    death_cause:\n        actor_died_error_context:\n            error_message: The actor is dead because `ray.kill` killed it.\n```\n\nIn this example, the death cause of the actor is shown as `ray.kill`, indicating that the actor was killed using the `ray.kill()` function.\n\nYou can also verify that the actor has been created using the `ray list actors` command. This will show you a list of all the actors in the cluster, along with their ID, class name, state, and other information.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nray list actors --detail\n-   actor_id: b5c990f135a7b32bfbb05e1701000000\n    class_name: Actor\n    death_cause: null\n    is_detached: false\n    job_id: '01000000'\n    name: ''\n    node_id: b552ca3009081c9de857a31e529d248ba051a4d3aeece7135dde8427\n    pid: 8795\n    placement_group_id: d2e660ac256db230dbe516127c4a01000000\n    ray_namespace: e5b19111-306c-4cd8-9e4f-4b13d42dff86\n    repr_name: ''\n    required_resources:\n        CPU_group_d2e660ac256db230dbe516127c4a01000000: 1.0\n    serialized_runtime_env: '{}'\n```\n\nIn this example, the actor has been created and is running on the cluster.

In your `run_config`, include the `WandbLoggerCallback` with the desired project name.\n5. Initialize WandB using `setup_wandb(config, project=\"Wandb_example\")` in your `train_function`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\nfrom ray import train, tune\nfrom ray.train import RunConfig\nfrom ray.air.integrations.wandb import WandbLoggerCallback\n\ndef train_func(config):\n    offset = random.random() / 5\n    for epoch in range(2, config[\"epochs\"]):\n        acc = 1 - (2 + config[\"lr\"]) ** -epoch - random.random() / epoch - offset\n        loss = (2 + config[\"lr\"]) ** -epoch + random.random() / epoch + offset\n        train.report({\"acc\": acc, \"loss\": loss})\n\ndef train_function_wandb(config):\n    wandb = setup_wandb(config, project=\"Wandb_example\")\n    return train_func(config)\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    train_function_wandb,\n    tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(\n        metric=\"loss\",\n        mode=\"min\",\n    ),\n    run_config=RunConfig(\n        callbacks=[WandbLoggerCallback(project=\"Wandb_example\")]\n    ),\n    param_space={\n        \"mean\": tune.grid_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),\n        \"sd\": tune.uniform(0.2, 0.8),\n    },\n)\n\ntuner.fit()\n```\n\nIn this example, `train_function_wandb` initializes WandB using `setup_wandb` and then calls the `train_func`. The `run_config` includes the `WandbLoggerCallback` with the specified project name.\n\nKeep in mind that `accelerateTrainer` is not explicitly used in this example, but you can integrate it with the `train_func` or `train_function_wandb` depending on your use case.",

This will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`. Note that Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\nRay will attempt to cancel tasks on a best-effort basis, meaning cancellation is not always guaranteed. You can check if a task was successfully cancelled by using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`.\n\nIf you want to cancel all child and Actor tasks, you can pass `recursive=True` to `ray.cancel()`.

To resolve this issue, you can use Ray's object store to store the large model and have the actor retrieve it, instead of loading it directly in the actor's constructor.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your actor class to load the model using `ray.put()`:\n```python\nimport ray\n\nclass BatchPredictor(object):\n    def __init__(self, model_ref):\n        self.model_ref = model_ref\n\n    def predict(self, file):\n        model = ray.get(self.model_ref)\n        # load data from file and predict using the model\n        # ...\n        return prediction_results\n\n# load the model and put it in the object store\nmodel = load_model()\nmodel_ref = ray.put(model)\n\n# create actors and pass the model_ref to them\nnum_actors = 4\nactors = [BatchPredictor.remote(model_ref) for _ in range(num_actors)]\n\n# use the actors to perform predictions\n# ...\n```\nBy storing the model in the object store and passing its reference to the actor, you can avoid having the actor load the model directly in its memory, which can help reduce its size and resolve the ValueError.",

Use `ray.train.torch.prepare_model` to wrap the model with DistributedDataParallel and place it on the right device.\n4. Use `ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader` to set up the DataLoader with DistributedSampler.\n5. Load the data shard for each worker with `session.get_dataset_shard(\"train\")`.\n6. Iterate over the dataset with `train_dataset.iter_torch_batches()`.\n\nHere's an example of how to define the `train_func_distributed` function:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import train\nimport tensorflow as tf  # Your custom neural net model should be defined here\n\ndef train_func_distributed(config):\n    num_epochs = config.get(\"num_epochs\")\n    batch_size = config.get(\"batch_size\")\n\n    # Load your custom neural net model\n    model = YourModel()\n    model = train.torch.prepare_model(model)\n\n    # Set up the data loader\n    dataset = get_dataset()\n    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)\n    dataloader = train.torch.prepare_data_loader(dataloader)\n\n    # Initialize the optimizer and other training components\n    optimizer = ...\n    lr_scheduler = ...\n\n    # Prepare everything for distributed training\n    (model, optimizer, train_dataloader, eval_dataloader, lr_scheduler) = accelerator.prepare(\n        model, optimizer, train_dataloader, eval_dataloader, lr_scheduler\n    )\n\n    # Start training\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        for batch in train_dataloader:\n            # Perform a training step\n            ...\n\n    # Report the results back to Ray Train\n    ...\n```\n\nFinally, create a `TorchTrainer` instance and call the `fit` method to start the distributed training:\n\n```python\ntrainer = TorchTrainer(\n    train_func_distributed,\n    scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=4, use_gpu=use_gpu)\n)\n\nresults = trainer.fit()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `YourModel` with your custom Keras neural net model and adjust the training code accordingly.",

This method computes the entire preprocessed dataset and pins it in the Ray object store memory, so when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run.\n\nRefer to the Ray Data documentation for more information on using Ray Data for preprocessing and ingest for ML training, as well as performance considerations.",

Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n1. During the training process, you can use the `tune.report()` function to save the best model checkpoint based on a given metric, such as validation accuracy. For example:\n```\ndef train_model(config):\n    model = Model(config)\n    for epoch in range(config[\"num_epochs\"]):\n        # Train the model\n        train_loss, train_acc = train(model)\n        # Evaluate the model\n        val_loss, val_acc = evaluate(model)\n        # Report the validation accuracy to Ray Tune\n        tune.report(mean_accuracy=val_acc)\n        # Save the best model checkpoint based on validation accuracy\n        if val_acc > best_val_acc:\n            best_val_acc = val_acc\n            model.save(\"best_model.pt\")\n```\n2. After the training process is complete, you can load the saved model checkpoint for inference. For example:\n```\nmodel = Model.load(\"best_model.pt\")\n# Use the loaded model to make predictions\npredictions = model.predict(data)\n```\nNote that this is just a general example, and the exact code will depend on the specific model and training process you are using.

However, this function is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I'll describe how to use it based on related functions and concepts.\n\nFirst, you need to define a collective group for the actors. In the provided context, a `Worker` class is defined with a `compute()` method that includes an allreduce operation. You can create actors from this class and add them to a collective group.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a collective group and perform an allreduce operation:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import put, get, worker\n\n# Create two actors A and B and create a collective group\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\n\n# Add actors to a collective group\ngroup = worker.get_current_group_membership()\ngroup.add(A)\ngroup.add(B)\n\n# Perform allreduce on a tensor\ntensor_a = put(get(A.buffer.remote()))\ntensor_b = put(get(B.buffer.remote()))\n\nreduced_tensor = ray.util.collective.allreduce(tensor_a, group=group)\n\n# Print the reduced tensor\nprint(reduced_tensor)\n```\n\nThis example assumes that the `Worker` class and the `buffer` attribute are defined as in the provided context. The `put()` function is used to wrap the tensors in a Ray object, and `get()` is used to retrieve the tensor data. The `allreduce()` function is then called with the tensor and the collective group as arguments.\n\nKeep in mind that the `ray.util.collective.allreduce()` function is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, so the above example might not work as-is in your use case. You might need to modify it based on your specific requirements and the available functions in your Ray version.",

Use `ray.init()` and `ray.shutdown()` to start and stop the Ray context.\n6. When testing with Ray Serve, use `Serve.getDeployment(\"deployment_name\")` to get a handle on the deployment.\n7. For normal Ray code, use the `.remote()` function to execute tasks in a different process.\n\nHere's an example of how to write a unit test for Ray code:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Initialize your Ray objects here\n        my_object = MyRayObject.remote()\n\n        # Run your tests here\n        result = ray.get(my_object.my_method.remote(arg1, arg2))\n        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `MyRayObject`, `my_method`, `arg1`, `arg2`, and `expected_result` with your actual Ray objects and test parameters.",

This will prevent task and actor logs from being copied to the driver's stdout.\n2. You can also try setting `RAY_TQDM_PATCH_PRINT=0` to disable the patching of the built-in `print` function, which may improve performance if there are more than a couple thousand updates per second.\n3. Ray deduplicates logs that appear redundantly across multiple processes by default. You can adjust the buffering time for subsequent log messages by changing the relevant configuration settings.\n4. If you are using `ray.get()` to retrieve object references, it may result in spamming of stdout. In such cases, you can try using asyncio or other concurrency primitives to avoid blocking the event loop.\n5. If none of the above steps work, you can try stopping the job using the command `ray job stop raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW` and then re-submit the job with the necessary configuration changes.\n\nRefer to the provided context for more details on each step.",

If you want to improve the performance of the shuffle, you can try iterating over batches of rows with shuffling, or setting the `DataContext.use_push_based_shuffle` flag to use a push-based shuffle algorithm.\n\nFor more information on how to optimize shuffling, and which approach to choose, see the [Optimize shuffling guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/optimize-shuffling.html).",

If you want to disable this feature and redirect the logs to a file or another output, you can view the Configuring Logging documentation.\n\nAdditionally, you can customize the prefixes for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class to replace the Actor name with a custom string, such as the Actor index.

We then define a class for batch inference with GPT-2, where we load the model in the constructor and perform inference on the input batch in the `__call__` method.\n\nNext, we read text data from an S3 bucket into a Ray Dataset and perform batch inference with GPT-2 on the Ray Dataset using the `map_batches` method. Finally, we save the inference results to an S3 bucket.\n\nNote that you will need to modify the `load_model` function and the `GPT2Inferencer` class to suit your specific use case. Also, make sure to replace `\"s3://your-bucket-name/your-text-data.txt\"` and `\"s3://your-bucket-name/your-inference-results.txt\"` with the actual S3 bucket names and file paths for your text data and inference results.",

However, it's important to note that if your tasks require CPU resources to execute, they will not be able to run without at least 1 CPU resource. Therefore, setting `num_cpus=0` may prevent your tasks from executing at all.\n\nAdditionally, if you are using Ray actors, it's recommended to explicitly set `num_cpus` to avoid any surprises. By default, actors use 1 CPU for scheduling and 0 CPU for running, which means they cannot get scheduled on a zero-cpu node. However, if you explicitly set `num_cpus` to 0 for an actor, it will not be able to reserve any CPU resources for its lifetime.\n\nIn summary, while setting `num_cpus=0` for tasks or actors may seem like a way to save resources, it can prevent your tasks and actors from executing or reserving necessary resources. It's recommended to set `num_cpus` to a positive value that reflects the actual CPU resource requirements of your tasks and actors.",

The memory usage is measured in RSS - SHR.\n\nIf you are using Ray 2.2 or later, there is an application-level memory monitor that can help prevent out-of-memory errors. You can enable and configure the memory monitor to detect and resolve memory issues.\n\nIf you notice a memory leak on a Serve actor, you can use `memray` to debug the issue. Set the environment variable `RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PROFILING=1` and run your Serve application. The Serve actors will run a `memray` tracker that logs their memory usage to bin files. You can then use the `memray flamegraph [bin file]` command to generate a flamegraph of the memory usage.\n\nThe `ray memory` command can also be used to help track down object references that may be causing an `ObjectStoreFullError`. Running `ray memory` from the command line while a Ray application is running will give you a dump of all object references that are currently held by the driver, actors, and tasks in the cluster.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Ray documentation on \"Debugging Out of Memory\" and \"Out-Of-Memory Prevention\".",

For example, to use the default RayTrainReportCallback, you can do:\n\n```python\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n)\n\ntrainer.add_callback(RayTrainReportCallback())\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can implement your own customized report callback by creating a class that inherits from `TrainerCallback` and overriding the relevant methods. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers.trainer_callback import TrainerCallback\n\nclass MyTrainReportCallback(TrainerCallback):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.metrics = {}\n\n    def on_train_end(self, args, state, control, **info):\n        # report metrics and checkpoints here\n        pass\n```\n\nAnd then add it to the trainer using `add_callback`:\n\n```python\ntrainer.add_callback(MyTrainReportCallback())\n```\n\nNote that the available callback hooks and their signatures may depend on the specific library or framework you are using.",

We can then push a new actor into the pool using the `push()` method.\n\nNote that the new actor will be created as a new Ray object and will not be part of the original actor class. If you want to configure the actor instantiation parameters, you can use the `options()` method of the actor class. For example:\n```python\nMyActor.options(num_cpus=2, num_gpus=1).remote()\n```\nThis will create a new instance of `MyActor` with 2 CPUs and 1 GPU.",

This will bypass normal upscaling speed constraints and immediately attempt to scale the cluster to accommodate the requested resources. For example:\n\n```\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=50)\n```\n\nThis will request 50 CPUs from the autoscaler, which will immediately attempt to scale the cluster to accommodate this request.\n\nFor more information on configuring and using the Ray autoscaler, you can refer to the \"Configuring Autoscaling\" section of the Ray documentation.",

            "answer": " Yes, it seems like you are experiencing a known issue with accessing the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node. This issue occurs because the dashboard port may not be publicly exposed in remote Ray clusters.\n\nTo access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node, you can set up port forwarding using the `ray dashboard` command. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n1. Run the following command on your local machine, where `cluster.yaml` is the configuration file you used to launch your cluster:\n\n   ```\n   ray dashboard cluster.yaml\n   ```\n\n   This command will automatically set up port forwarding between your local machine and the head node, making the Ray Dashboard viewable in your local browser at `localhost:8265`.\n\nIf the dashboard still disappears after setting up port forwarding, it could be due to an internal refresh failure. In this case, you can try customizing the Ray Dashboard port to see if that resolves the issue. Here's how to do that:\n\n1. Start the Ray cluster explicitly with the CLI and pass the `--dashboard-port` argument with `ray start` in the command line. For example:\n\n   ```\n   ray start --dashboard-port=8267\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can start the cluster implicitly with `ray.init` and pass the `dashboard_port` keyword argument in your call to `ray.init()`. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   import ray\n   ray.init(dashboard_port=8267)\n   ```\n\n   Once you have customized the dashboard port, you can access the Ray Dashboard from your local machine by navigating to `http://localhost:8267` in your web browser.",

It is responsible for various cluster-level operations such as actor and placement group management. However, by default, the GCS is not fault-tolerant, as all data is stored in-memory and its failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail.\n\nYour GCS server might be taking up a lot of memory on the head node due to several reasons. First, the head node has more memory-demanding system components, such as GCS or the dashboard. Second, if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and you execute the same number of tasks and actors from a head node, it can easily run out of memory. To avoid this, you can specify --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node using ray start --head, which prevents running any tasks and actors on the head node.

Check for Python-level exceptions: Ray surfaces application-level failures as Python-level exceptions. When a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result.\n\n2. Use Ray logging: Ray logging can help you understand system-level behavior and surface application-level details during runtime. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n\nFor more specific Ray exceptions, you can refer to the ray.exceptions module, which includes errors like RaySystemError, ObjectReconstructionFailedLineageEvictedError, RuntimeEnvSetupError, CrossLanguageError, and others. These exceptions can provide more context when debugging Ray applications.",

Make sure to replace `your_trainable_function` with the actual trainable function used in your experiment.\n\nAfter restoring the experiment, you can analyze the trials and their checkpoints using various Tune features and functionalities.",

Here is an example:\n\n```\nactor_handle.Kill();\n```\n\nThis will cause the actor to immediately exit its process, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a `RayActorError`.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nNote that after calling `ray.kill` on an actor handle, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nIn Python, you can also use the `ray.kill` function to kill an actor forcefully. Here is an example:\n\n```\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\n\nThis will interrupt any running tasks on the actor, causing them to fail immediately. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will not be run.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nIf the actor is a detached actor, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nNote that garbage collection for actors has not been implemented yet, so this is currently the only way to terminate an actor gracefully. The `ObjectRef` resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit (calling `ObjectRef::Get` on it will throw a `RayActorException`).\n\nNote that this method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with `sys.exit()`. You can see the actor is dead as a result of the user's `exit_actor()` call by running `ray list actors --detail`.\n\nA remote actor will be terminated when all actor handles to it in Python are deleted, which will cause them to complete any outstanding work and then shut down. If you only have 1 reference to an actor handle, calling `del actor` could trigger actor deletion. Note that your program may have multiple references to the same `ActorHandle`, and actor termination will not occur until the reference count goes to 0.\n\nIf you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`.",

However, there is no direct `exclude` option in the `RuntimeEnv` class or its methods.\n\nIf you want to exclude certain fields from the runtime environment, you can create a new `RuntimeEnv` object with the desired fields and exclude the ones you don't want to include. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray.runtime_env import RuntimeEnv, RuntimeEnvConfig\n\n# Parent's `runtime_env`\nparent_runtime_env = {\n    \"pip\": [\"requests\", \"chess\"],\n    \"env_vars\": {\"A\": \"a\", \"B\": \"b\"}\n}\n\n# Create a new runtime environment with excluded fields\nchild_runtime_env = RuntimeEnv(\n    py_modules=parent_runtime_env.get(\"py_modules\"),\n    working_dir=parent_runtime_env.get(\"working_dir\"),\n    # Exclude pip and env_vars fields\n    **{k: v for k, v in parent_runtime_env.items() if k not in [\"pip\", \"env_vars\"]}\n)\n\n# Set the new runtime environment for a job\njob_config = ray.job_config.JobConfig()\njob_config.set_runtime_env(child_runtime_env)\n```\nIn this example, the `child_runtime_env` object is created with the `py_modules` and `working_dir` fields from the `parent_runtime_env` object, and excludes the `pip` and `env_vars` fields. The new runtime environment is then set for a job using the `set_runtime_env` method.",

If this variable is not set, Ray Dashboard uses the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`.\n\nHere's an example of how to set these variables in a Kubernetes environment:\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  - name: RAY_GRAFANA_HOST\n    value: http://grafana.example.com\n  - name: RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST\n    value: http://prometheus.example.com\n  - name: RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME\n    value: Prometheus\n```\n\nReplace `http://grafana.example.com` and `http://prometheus.example.com` with the actual addresses that the head node can use to access Grafana and Prometheus, respectively. Replace `Prometheus` with the actual name of the Prometheus data source in Grafana.",

This function is used to retrieve the result of a remote function call, and the `timeout` parameter allows you to specify the maximum amount of time to wait for the result before raising a `GetTimeoutError`.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this feature:\n\n```\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n@ray.remote\ndef long_running_function():\n    time.sleep(8)\n\nobj_ref = long_running_function.remote()\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `long_running_function` will sleep for 8 seconds, but the `ray.get()` function will only wait for 4 seconds before raising a `GetTimeoutError`. This allows you to add a timeout to your Ray job and continue with other tasks if the job takes too long to complete.\n\nYou can also set a timeout for the runtime environment creation by using the `setup_timeout_seconds` parameter in the `ray.init()` function. This parameter specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the runtime environment to be created before raising a `TimeoutError`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nray.init(setup_timeout_seconds=4)\n```\n\nThis will set a timeout of 4 seconds for the runtime environment creation. If the environment is not created within this time, a `TimeoutError` will be raised.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Use the `get_log` function to retrieve a particular log file from a node:\n```python\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\nget_log(filename=\"gcs_server.out\", node_id=<NODE_ID>)\n```\nReplace `<NODE_ID>` with the actual node ID or IP. Note that you can also use the `ray logs` CLI command with the `--node-id` option to retrieve logs.\n\nIf you need to access logs after the cluster or some of the nodes are stopped or terminated, you need to store and persist the logs.

This could be due to several reasons such as:\n\n* The head node is not running or is inaccessible at the specified address.\n* A different version of Ray is running at the specified address.\n* The specified address is wrong.\n* There are firewall settings preventing access.\n\nTo troubleshoot, you can check if the head node is running and accessible at the specified address. You can also check if there are any firewall settings preventing access. Additionally, you can use a tool such as nmap or nc to check if each port can be reached from a node.\n\nIf you are using an external Redis for fault tolerance, make sure that the RAY\\_REDIS\\_ADDRESS env var and --redis-password are correctly set in the Ray head node section of the Kubernetes deployment config file.\n\nIf you are running workers with Service Accounts, make sure that the service account is correctly configured for the worker nodes to access Google Cloud Storage.\n\nIf you have already tried these steps and the issue persists, it may be due to the ray.io/external-storage-namespace annotation being the same for both old and new RayClusters. You can remove the annotation and KubeRay will automatically generate a unique key for each RayCluster custom resource.\n\nIf the head node is still inaccessible, you can set up an external Redis instance as a data store for the Ray head to recover its state from the external Redis instance in case of a crash.

Configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using `ray.init()` and specifying the `object_spilling_config` parameter with the desired directory path.\n3. If using an HDD, specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.\n4. Monitor disk usage to prevent running out of disk space and triggering `OutOfDiskError`.\n\nObject spilling is enabled by default in Ray 1.3+ and will spill objects to disk if necessary. It is recommended to use Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem for spilling.",

It has a CLI, an API with functions for initialization, shutdown, and job configuration, and supports cross-language scheduling and runtime environments. Ray resources, which are key-value pairs representing physical machines and computation, enable seamless scaling from a laptop to a cluster. The Ray API is a universal programming interface for distributed computing, built on familiar Python concepts.\n\nTo learn more, check out the Ray Core Examples Gallery or some of the ML workloads in the Use Case Gallery.",
