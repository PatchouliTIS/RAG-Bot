The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node, increases or decreases the number of worker nodes in the cluster when the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed or are below the current capacity. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When Ray Serve scales down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider if there aren't enough available CPUs to place the requested actors.",

            "generated_answer": " To debug why Ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can use the `RolloutWorker.lock()` method. This method locks the RolloutWorker via its own threading.Lock. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nimport gymnasium as gym\nfrom ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker import RolloutWorker\nfrom ray.rllib.algorithms.pg.pg_tf_policy import PGTF1Policy\n\nworker = RolloutWorker(\n    env_creator=lambda _: gym.make(\"CartPole-v1\"),\n    default_policy_class=PGTF1Policy,\n    config=AlgorithmConfig(),\n)\n\n# Lock the RolloutWorker before sampling\nworker.lock()\nprint(worker.sample())\n```\n\nThis will ensure that no other threads or processes can access the RolloutWorker while it's locked, which can help prevent deadlocks. However, keep in mind that this may also reduce the parallelism of your code, so use it with caution.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that you have enough available CPUs in your Ray cluster, as a lack of available CPUs can also cause deadlocks. You can check the available CPUs in your Ray cluster by checking the Ray dashboard or using the Ray CLI.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug why ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can try setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` if you encounter errors like `blas_thread_init: pthread_create: Resource temporarily unavailable` when using many workers. You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

Multiple Ray workers on the same node can read the numpy array in the object store without copying (zero-copy reads). To achieve this, you can convert your Dataset into a distributed set of NumPy ndarrays or dictionary of NumPy ndarrays using `Dataset.to_numpy_refs()`. However, keep in mind that this function induces a copy of the data.\n\nFor zero-copy access to the underlying data, consider using `Dataset.to_arrow()` or `Dataset.get_internal_block_refs()`. When working with numpy arrays within Ray, avoid writing to the read-only object directly. Instead, copy it into the local process memory before making changes.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `to_numpy_refs()`:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\nds = ray.data.range(10, parallelism=2)\nrefs = ds.to_numpy_refs()\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how to use `from_numpy_refs()` to create a Dataset from a list of Ray object references to NumPy ndarrays:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\narr_ref = ray.put(np.array([1]))\nray.data.from_numpy_refs(arr_ref)\n```",

This could lead to performance issues and resource waste.\n\nThe second option, creating key pools, is a more advisable approach. This strategy allows you to manage a more reasonable number of actors while still providing efficient key lookups.\n\nIn the context provided, the recommended strategy for the number of actors is to multiply the number of Ray nodes in the cluster by four.

            "generated_answer": " To write a map function for `map_batches`, define a function or class that takes a batch of data (as a Table, DataFrame, or dict of numpy arrays) and returns a transformed batch. The function can return the same type as the input or a different type, such as an Iterator of transformed batches. Here's an example of a function that returns a list of objects:\n\n```python\ndef map_fn(batch):\n    result = []\n    for item in batch:\n        # Perform some transformation on the item\n        transformed_item = {\"id\": item[\"id\"] * 2}\n        result.append(transformed_item)\n    return result\n\nds.map_batches(map_fn)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `map_fn` function takes a batch of data, transforms each item in the batch, and appends the transformed item to a list. The function then returns the list of transformed items. Note that this example returns a list of objects, which is different from the input type.\n\nWhen using `map_batches`, keep in mind that the batch size may be smaller than the specified batch size if the batch size does not evenly divide the block(s) sent to a given map task. Also, if your function returns large objects, yield outputs in chunks to avoid creating large intermediate objects.",

Here is an example:\\n\\n```\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef add_dog_years(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch['age_in_dog_years'] = 7 * batch['age']\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.from_items([\n        {'name': 'Luna', 'age': 4},\n        {'name': 'Rory', 'age': 14},\n        {'name': 'Scout', 'age': 9},\n    ])\n    .map_batches(add_dog_years)\n)\nds.show()\n```\\n\\nIn this example, `add_dog_years` is a function that adds a new field `age_in_dog_years` to the input batch.

Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport psutil\n\ndef train_model(config):\n    # Get the memory limit\n    memory_limit = config.get(\"memory_limit\")\n\n    # Calculate the memory limit in bytes\n    if memory_limit is not None:\n        memory_limit = int(memory_limit * 1024 * 1024)\n\n    # Function to monitor memory usage\n    def monitor_memory():\n        process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())\n        mem_info = process.memory_info()\n        return mem_info.rss\n\n    # Train the model with memory limit\n    while True:\n        current_memory = monitor_memory()\n        if memory_limit is not None and current_memory > memory_limit:\n            raise Exception(f\"Memory limit of {memory_limit} bytes exceeded\")\n        # Your training code here\n```\n\nThen, when creating the `train_model` function, you can set the memory limit as a configuration:\n\n```python\ntrain_model = tune.with_resources(train_model, {\"cpu\": 1, \"memory_limit\": 4})  # 4 GB limit\n```\n\nThis way, the trial will be stopped if the memory limit is exceeded.

The `fn_kwargs` parameter is a dictionary that maps the name of the extra argument (`\"extra_arg\"`) to its value (`\"some value\"`).\n\nYou can replace `\"some value\"` with any value that you want to pass as the extra argument. For example, you can pass a variable, a constant, a list, a dictionary, or any other Python object.\n\nNote that the `fn_kwargs` parameter is optional, and you can use it only if your UDF accepts keyword arguments. If your UDF does not accept keyword arguments, you can use the `fn_args` parameter instead to pass extra positional arguments.

However, the contexts provided do not show any direct example of allreducing among a list of actors. \n\nHere's a general idea of how you might implement this using the provided context:\n\n1. First, ensure that all actors have the same tensor you want to allreduce.\n2. Create a custom actor with a method that performs the allreduce on its tensor using `ray.util.collective.allreduce()`.\n3. Call this method on each actor, passing the group name as a parameter.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a custom actor with a method for allreduce:\n\n```python\nimport cupy as cp\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.collective import allreduce\n\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\nclass Worker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.buffer = cp.ones((10,), dtype=cp.float32)\n\n    def allreduce_on_actor(self):\n        allreduce(self.buffer, op=allreduce.ReduceOp.SUM, group_name=\"default\")\n        return self.buffer\n\n# Create two actors A and B and create a collective group following the previous example...\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\n\n# Invoke allreduce remotely\nray.get([A.allreduce_on_actor.remote(), B.allreduce_on_actor.remote()])\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a general idea based on the provided context. You might need to adjust the code to fit your specific use case.",
            "reference_answer": "To perform an all_reduce operation among a list of actors, you can use the 'apply_reduce' function provided in the context. This function takes in the results from each actor, and reduces them into a single output by adding up all word occurrences. The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

Remote operations in Ray are asynchronous, and you can use `.remote()` postfix to every remote function, remote class declaration, or invocation of a remote class method.

Unnecessary calls to `ray.get()` for intermediate steps can harm performance. Work with object references directly and only call `ray.get()` at the end to get the final result.\n3.

Make sure to instantiate the recv side call before fetching objects.\n\nIn your specific case, ensure that you're not calling `ray.get()` in a loop or unnecessarily, and that you're not fetching too many objects at once.

            "generated_answer": " To add logging inside an actor, you can use the Python `logging` module. Here is an example:\n\n1. First, import the `logging` module.\n2. Create a logger using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.\n3. Use the logger's methods (e.g., `logger.info()`, `logger.error()`) to log messages.\n\nHere is some example code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\n# Create an instance of the actor and call the log method\nactor = MyActor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nIn addition, you can customize the prefixes for actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the actor class. This can be useful if you have a large number of worker actors and want to easily see the index of the actor that logged a particular message. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self, index):\n        self.index = index\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"MyActor(index={self.index})\"\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\n# Create an instance of the actor and call the log method\nactor = MyActor.remote(0)\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nThis will print a log message with the prefix `MyActor(index=0)`.",

For example:\n\n```\nfrom transformers.trainer_callback import TrainerCallback\n\nclass MyTrainReportCallback(TrainerCallback):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.metrics = {}\n\n    def on_train_begin(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n        # Do something at the beginning of training\n        pass\n\n    def on_train_end(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n        # Do something at the end of training\n        pass\n\n    def on_save(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n        # Do something when a checkpoint is saved\n        pass\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    callbacks=[MyTrainReportCallback()]\n)\n```\n\nYou can then use this custom callback in the same way as the `RayTrainReportCallback`.",

This allows you to update and access data from any worker or task in the Ray cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `ray.put()` and `ray.get()`:\n\n```python\n# Put data into the object store\nray.put(\"my_data\", \"Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Get data from the object store\ndata = ray.get(\"my_data\")\nprint(data)  # Output: Hello, Ray!\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.put()` function to store a file in the object store and then use the `ray.get_file()` function to retrieve it.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `ray.put()` and `ray.get_file()`:\n\n```python\n# Put a file into the object store\nray.put(\"my_file.txt\", \"/path/to/my/file.txt\")\n\n# Get a file from the object store\nray.get_file(\"my_file.txt\", \"/path/to/destination/folder\")\n```\n\nNote that the `ray.put()` function returns a object ID that can be used to retrieve the data later using the `ray.get()` or `ray.get_file()` functions.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the `ray.put()` function serializes the data before storing it in the object store, so it may not be suitable for large data sets or files. In those cases, you may want to consider using a distributed file system or a database that is compatible with Ray.",

You can find the log at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*`.\n3. If you are using Kubernetes, you can check the Kubernetes events for the pending nodes using the `kubectl describe pod` command. Look for any errors or warnings related to resource allocation or scheduling.\n4. You can also check the Ray worker logs for any errors or warnings related to the pending nodes. You can find the logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/worker*`.\n5. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you can try restarting the Ray cluster using `ray up`. This will restart all Ray services even if there are no config changes.\n\nHere is a relevant code snippet that shows how to wait for all nodes to join the cluster:\n```python\ndef wait_for_nodes(expected):\n    # Wait for all nodes to join the cluster.\n    while True:\n        num_nodes = len(ray.nodes())\n        if num_nodes < expected:\n            print(\n                \"{} nodes have joined so far, waiting for {} more.\".format(\n                    num_nodes, expected - num_nodes\n                )\n            )\n            sys.stdout.flush()\n            time.sleep(1)\n        else:\n            break\n```\nThis code will wait for the expected number of nodes to join the cluster before proceeding.",

            "generated_answer": " To get more detailed errors or logs when Ray Serve returns a generic internal service error, you can leverage Ray logging. Ray Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, making it convenient for debugging.\n\nAdditionally, when a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError and stores this as the task's return value. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result. You can catch these exceptions to get more detailed information about the error.\n\nHere's an example of how to catch exceptions in Ray:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef f():\n    raise Exception(\"the real error\")\n\n@ray.remote\ndef g(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ntry:\n    result = ray.get(f.remote())\nexcept ray.exceptions.RayTaskError as e:\n    print(\"Detailed error:\", e.exception)\n    print(\"Task info:\", e.task_info)\n```\n\nThis will print the detailed error message and task information when the task `f()` fails.",

Use the `ray up` command to start the Ray cluster:\n```\nray up -y config.yaml\n```\nThis command will create the cluster on the cloud, starting a designated \"head node\" and worker nodes.\n\nTo run Ray programs on the cluster, you can use the `ray.init()` function to connect to the Ray cluster. For example:\n```python\nimport ray\nray.init()\n# Your Ray program here\n```\nThis will connect to the latest Ray cluster. You can also specify the Ray cluster address to connect to a specific cluster. For example:\n```python\nimport ray\nray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:10001\")\n# Your Ray program here\n```\nReplace `<head_node_host>` with the hostname or IP address of the head node.",

Additionally, if one process is using most of the CPUs and the others are using a small amount, this may be the problem. A common issue is PyTorch, which will appear to be using all the cores despite needing `torch.set_num_threads(1)` to be called to avoid contention. Another possible reason could be that the Ray cluster currently does not have any available CPUs for Ray Data to run on, which can prevent Ray Data from scheduling tasks, reducing performance or causing workloads to hang. To ensure CPU resources are always available for Ray Data execution, you can limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the `max_concurrent_trials` Tune option.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n@ray.remote\ndef long_running_function():\n    time.sleep(8)\n\nobj_ref = long_running_function.remote()\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `long_running_function` will sleep for 8 seconds, and the `ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)` line will wait for the result for up to 4 seconds. If the result is not available within 4 seconds, a `GetTimeoutError` will be raised.",

By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold.
