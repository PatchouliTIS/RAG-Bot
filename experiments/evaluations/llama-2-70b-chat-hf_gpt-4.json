Here's a summary of the relevant information from the provided context:\n\n* `map_batches()` is a method of the `Dataset` class in Ray Data that applies a user-defined function to each batch of data.\n* The function should take a batch of data as input and return a transformed batch of data.\n* The batches are represented as dictionaries of NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames.\n* You can specify the batch format using the `batch_format` parameter of `map_batches()`.\n* If you don't specify a batch size, the default batch size of 4096 may be too large for some datasets.\n* You can use the `assert_batch()` function to specify that each input batch should be of a certain size.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `map_batches()` to transform a dataset:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset from a NumPy array\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((10, 100)))\n\n# Define a function to increase the brightness of an image\ndef increase_brightness(batch):\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\n# Apply the function to the dataset\nds = ds.map_batches(increase_brightness)\n```\nI hope this helps!

The answer is that you can use `asyncio.wait()` to wait for a Ray future object, just like you would wait for any other asyncio future object.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_task():\n    return 1\n\nasync def await_obj_ref():\n    await some_task.remote()\n    await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])\n\nasyncio.run(await_obj_ref())\n```\nThis code defines a Ray task `some_task` that returns a future object, and then uses `asyncio.wait()` to wait for that future object to complete. The `await_obj_ref()` function is marked as `async` to allow it to use the `await` keyword to wait for the future object.\n\nNote that in order to use `asyncio` with Ray, you'll need to make sure that you're running the Ray actor with the `num_cpus=0` parameter, as shown in the example code. This tells Ray to use a single CPU for the actor, which allows the actor to block on I/O operations without causing performance issues.\n\nI hope this helps!

Firstly, Ray Serve supports multi-model composition using a programmable API, allowing for flexible model composition and scaling. This makes it easier to build complex inference services consisting of multiple ML models and business logic, all in Python code. Additionally, Ray Serve enables flexible resource allocation and scaling, allowing for the efficient use of resources and easy management of high traffic models.\n\nFurthermore, Ray Serve provides several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models, such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, and multi-node/multi-GPU serving. It also supports both batch and online inference, and can scale to thousands of models in production.\n\nIn contrast, using containers with Modal or Seldon may be limiting and hard to work with, as it requires managing and orchestrating multiple containers, which can be complex and time-consuming. Ray Serve, on the other hand, provides a simpler and more efficient way to manage and scale model serving, allowing developers to focus on building and deploying their models rather than managing infrastructure.\n\nTherefore, Ray Serve is a better choice than Modal or Seldon for model serving, especially for complex inference services consisting of multiple ML models and business logic, and for large language model applications that require rapid prototyping, development, and deployment to production.",

It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

For example, to set the minimum time per iteration to 10 seconds, you can use the following code:\n```\nmin_time_s_per_iteration = 10\n```\nThis will tell RLlib to accumulate experience for at least 10 seconds before computing metrics and updating the policy.\n\nNote that these parameters can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your environment and policy.

The `run_trial` function runs the trial and catches any errors that occur. If the trial failed and the error is recoverable, it schedules a retry using the `get_scheduler().schedule_trial` method.\n\nYou can also use the `on_trial_recover` callback to restore the trial scheduler from a checkpoint and continue the trial from the last successful step. Here's an example:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune.schedulers import get_scheduler\nfrom ray.tune.trial import Trial\n\n# Define a trial retry policy\ndef retry_policy(trial):\n    # Retry the trial if it failed with a recoverable error\n    if trial.status == Trial.FAILED and trial.error.is_recoverable():\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Define a trial runner\ndef run_trial(trial):\n    # Run the trial and catch any errors\n    try:\n        trial.run()\n    except Exception as e:\n        # If the trial failed, schedule a retry\n        if retry_policy(trial):\n            # Restore the trial scheduler from the last checkpoint\n            checkpoint_path = trial.last_checkpoint_path\n            scheduler = get_scheduler()\n            scheduler.restore(checkpoint_path)\n            # Continue the trial from the last successful step\n            trial.status = Trial.RUNNING\n            trial.step = trial.last_step + 1\n            scheduler.schedule_trial(trial)\n\n# Start the Ray Tune trial\ntuner = ray.tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space)\nresults = tuner.fit(run_trial)\n```\nIn this example, the `retry_policy` function checks if the trial failed with a recoverable error and returns `True` if it should be retried. The `run_trial` function runs the trial and catches any errors that occur. If the trial failed and the error is recoverable, it restores the trial scheduler from the last checkpoint using the `get_scheduler().restore` method and continues the trial from the last successful step using the `trial.status = Trial.RUNNING` and `trial.step = trial.last_step + 1` assignments. Finally, it schedules the trial again using the `get_scheduler().schedule_trial` method.\n\nNote that you can also use the `TUNE_FORCE_TRIAL_CLEANUP_S` environment variable to forcefully terminate trials that have failed and clean up their resources. This can be useful if you want to prevent trials from consuming excessive resources or causing other issues.",

            "generated_answer": " To use `ray.put` and `ray.get`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, initialize the Ray cluster by calling `ray.init()` and passing in an address to connect to an existing cluster.\n2. Use `ray.put()` to store an object in the object store. This method takes in the object to be stored and returns its ID.\n3. To retrieve an object from the object store, use `ray.get()` and pass in the ID of the object. This method returns the object or a list of objects.\n4. If you need to wait for the object to be ready, you can use `ray.wait()` to block until the object is available.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n```\nray.init('localhost:7000')\n\n# Store an object in the object store\nobj_id = ray.put(MyObject('hello', 'world'))\n\n# Wait for the object to be ready\nray.wait(obj_id)\n\n# Get the object from the object store\nobj = ray.get(obj_id)\n\nprint(obj.message)  # Output: 'hello world'\n```\nNote that `ray.put()` and `ray.get()` are synchronous operations, meaning that they block until the operation is complete. To avoid blocking, you can use `ray.wait()` to wait for the object to be ready before calling `ray.get()`.\n\nIt's also a good practice to delay calling `ray.get()` as long as possible, or even design your program to avoid calling it altogether. Instead, use `ray.put()` to create a copy of the object in the object store, and then use `ray.get()` to retrieve the object when it's needed. This approach can help reduce the number of requests made to the object store and improve performance.",
            "reference_answer": "To use ray.put and ray.get in Python, you first import the ray module. You can use ray.put() to store a value in the object store, which returns an object reference. You can then use ray.get() to fetch the result of a remote object from the object reference. If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object. You can also set a timeout to return early from a get that's blocking for too long. Similar methods are used in Java and C++, with slight syntax differences.",

This method is lazy, meaning it won't perform execution until you consume the results.\n\nFor tabular data, you can use Ray Data's out-of-the-box preprocessors, such as MinMaxScaler, to implement common feature preprocessing operations. You can apply these preprocessors to your dataset before passing it into a Trainer.\n\nIf your preprocessed dataset is small enough to fit in Ray's object store memory, you can call the `materialize()` method on the preprocessed dataset to pin it in the Ray object store memory. This will allow you to iterate over the dataset repeatedly without re-running the preprocessing operations.\n\nFor unstructured data, you can use existing Ray Data operations instead of preprocessors. Ray Data serves as a last-mile bridge from storage or ETL pipeline outputs to distributed applications and libraries in Ray, so it's recommended to use it for preprocessing and ingest for ML training.\n\nYou can find more information on how to use Ray Data for preprocessing and ingest for ML training in the Ray Data documentation.",

We then create an actor from this class using Ray's `remote` module, and serialize the actor's state using the `pickle` module. We then deserialize the actor's state and use the `increment` and `get_counter` methods to modify and retrieve the counter's value.\n\nNote that the `pickle` module is not built-in to Ray, so you'll need to install it separately using `pip install pickle`.

The snippets cover various topics, such as creating actors, declaring collective groups, sending messages, listing actors, summarizing actors, objects, and tasks, transforming batches with actors, and invoking methods on actors.\n\nTo perform an all_reduce operation among a list of actors, you can use the `ray.util.state.all_reduce` function. This function takes a list of actors and a reduction function as input and applies the reduction function to each actor's state. Here's an example code snippet:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Create a list of actors\nactors = [ray.actor.Actor.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n\n# Define a reduction function\ndef add_states(state1, state2):\n    return state1 + state2\n\n# Perform an all_reduce operation\nresult = ray.util.state.all_reduce(actors, add_states)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\nIn this example, the `add_states` function takes two actor states as input and returns their sum.

In the `setUp` method, you can initialize the Ray cluster with a fixed number of CPUs and GPUs using `ray.init`. In the test methods, you can create tasks and assert that they complete successfully using `ray.get`. You can also use `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` to create a mini-cluster for testing.\n\nHere's an example of a unit test for Ray code:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_counter(self):\n        counter_class = ray.cross_language.java_actor_class(\n            \"io.ray.demo.Counter\"\n        )\n        counter = counter_class.remote()\n        obj_ref1 = counter.increment.remote()\n        assert ray.get(obj_ref1) == 1\n        obj_ref2 = counter.increment.remote()\n        assert ray.get(obj_ref2) == 2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\nThis test class initializes a Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, creates a Java actor that implements the `Counter` class, and calls the `increment` method twice to verify that the actor's state is updated correctly.\n\nYou can run this test using the `python -m unittest` command in your terminal.",

You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

Ray also integrates with popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Async actors can be defined using async method definitions, and Ray automatically detects whether an actor supports async calls or not. However, running blocking ray.get or ray.wait inside an async actor method is not allowed, as it blocks the execution of the event loop. Only one task can be running at any point in time in an async actor, and there is only one thread in an async actor. Ray seeks to cancel the associated asyncio.Task for tasks classified as async actors, aligning with the standards presented in asyncio task cancellation.",

You can also add multiple callbacks by passing a list of callback objects.\n\nAlternatively, you can implement your own custom callback class and pass an instance of it to the `callbacks` list. For example:\n```\nclass MyCustomCallback(Callback):\n    def on_train_epoch_end(self, trainer, pl_module):\n        # Custom code to be executed at the end of each epoch\n        pass\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    callbacks=[MyCustomCallback()]\n)\n```\nThis will call the `on_train_epoch_end` method of your custom callback class at the end of each epoch.

The GCS server is not fault-tolerant by default, and its failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, HA Redis is required. The head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it, such as GCS, and it is recommended to have a good starting hardware specification for the head node, such as 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The Ray head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and it is recommended to not run any Tasks and Actors on the head node to avoid out-of-memory problems. The GCS server is checkpointed to the Ray Global Control Store on the head node, and transient data in the router and replica will be lost in case of failure. The operating system settings should be tuned to support the number of connections created by all nodes and workers connecting to the GCS.",

Here are some suggestions for debugging and resolving the issue:\n\n1. Check the Ray cluster status using `ray status`. This command will show you the current state of the cluster, including the number of healthy and pending nodes.\n2. Look for any error messages or warnings in the logs that may indicate the cause of the issue. You can find the logs by running `ray logs`.\n3. Check that the Raylet address is correctly configured on each node. Make sure that the IP address of each node matches the Raylet address.\n4. Ensure that the head node is not overloaded with too many simultaneous connections. You can check the number of connections by running `ray status`. If the head node is overloaded, consider adding more nodes to the cluster or reducing the number of connections.\n5. Try starting the worker nodes more slowly, as suggested in the debugging routing issues section. You can do this by adding a delay between the start of each worker node.\n6. Check that there are enough available CPUs in the cluster. If there are no available CPUs, the Dataset job will hang. You can check the number of available CPUs by running `ray status`. If there are no available CPUs, consider adding more nodes to the cluster or reducing the number of actors.\n7. Consider disabling the scheduler events to stop receiving notifications about the pending nodes. You can do this by setting the environment variable `RAY_SCHEDULER_EVENTS` to `0`.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you debug and resolve the issue with the pending nodes in your Ray cluster.",

            "generated_answer": " The reason why your Ray tuner shows \"running\" but CPU usage is almost 0% is that Ray Tune is not able to schedule tasks due to a lack of available CPU resources. This is caused by the fact that the Ray actor requires 1 CPU when it is scheduled, but after it is created, it occupies 0 CPU. As a result, the Ray Data actor is not able to schedule tasks, reducing performance or causing workloads to hang.\n\nTo overcome this issue, you can limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the max_concurrent_trials Tune option. This will ensure that there are always enough free CPU resources available for Ray Data execution, preventing the workloads from hanging or reducing performance.\n\nAdditionally, you can set the number of CPUs that Ray uses by overriding the detected resources by setting them in ray.init like: ray.init(num_cpus=2). This will allow Ray to use 2 CPUs, which should improve the performance of your application.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the issue may be caused by other factors such as insufficient CPU resources, high CPU usage by other processes, or network issues. You can use the Ray logs to investigate the issue further and identify the root cause.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

The autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The Ray autoscaler has fine-grained control over scale-down, allowing it to select precisely which pods to scale down and delete. The KubeRay operator then deletes the selected pod. The Ray autoscaler and the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler complement each other, with the Ray autoscaler deciding to create or delete a Ray pod, and the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler provisioning or cleaning up the corresponding Kubernetes node.",

Instead, the Ray autoscaler, a Ray cluster process, automatically scales a cluster up and down based on resource demand.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones.

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold.
