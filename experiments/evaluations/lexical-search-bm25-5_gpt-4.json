            "generated_answer": " Ray Serve's autoscaling feature automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a deployment based on its load. The Ray autoscaler, a process that runs on the head node, increases or decreases the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on the resource demands of tasks and actors. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates replica actors, the Ray autoscaler removes nodes with no Ray actors or tasks running on them. This process is similar when using Kubernetes, where the Ray autoscaler adjusts the number of Ray pods in the cluster.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Overloading a node with more tasks than the resources allow could cause issues like out-of-memory errors. To avoid this, you can reduce the number of concurrent tasks or increase the resources available on the node. Additionally, you can specify lower resource requirements for tasks that can benefit from more IO parallelism. Ray's locality-aware scheduling also helps by preferring nodes with large task arguments local to avoid transferring data over the network.",

Therefore, you should determine the amount of memory to allocate to Ray based on the total available memory on your system and the memory requirements of the model.\n\nAdditionally, you should ensure that you have a GPU with at least 16 GB of memory available, as the model may require a significant amount of GPU memory.\n\nHere's an example of how you might set the `object_store_memory` parameter based on the total available memory on your system:\n\n* If you have 32 GB of total available memory, you might set `object_store_memory` to 10 GB (30% of 32 GB):\n```json\n\"object_store_memory\": 10000\n```\n* If you have 64 GB of total available memory, you might set `object_store_memory` to 20 GB (30% of 64 GB):\n```json\n\"object_store_memory\": 20000\n```\nNote that these are just examples, and you should adjust the value based on your specific system configuration and the memory requirements of the model.

You can then save the checkpoint to disk using the `to_directory()` method. For example:\n```python\n# Save the checkpoint to disk\ncheckpoint.to_directory(\"my_model\")\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `my_model` and save the checkpoint data to it. You can then restore the model from the checkpoint using the `from_directory()` method:\n```python\n# Restore the model from the checkpoint\nrestored_model = TensorflowCheckpoint.from_directory(\"my_model\").get_model()\n```\nNote that the `get_model()` method returns a new instance of the model, so you'll need to assign it to a new variable.",

A Ray cluster consists of a head node and worker nodes connected together. Ray clusters can be fixed-size or autoscale according to the resources requested by applications running on the cluster. Ray can run on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes. It is recommended to match the Ray and Autoscaler code versions when running multiple Ray clusters at different Ray versions. Ray clusters do not provide strong resource isolation and do not support priorities, so it is not recommended to run multiple jobs from different users simultaneously in a Ray cluster in production.",

When working with Ray Datasets, you can convert them to a distributed set of numpy array references using `Dataset.to_numpy_refs()` method. However, keep in mind that this method induces a copy of the data. For zero-copy access to the underlying data, consider using `Dataset.to_arrow()` or `Dataset.get_internal_block_refs()`.\n\nHere's an example of using `to_numpy_refs()`:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\nray.init()\n\nds = ray.data.range(10, parallelism=2)\nrefs = ds.to_numpy_refs()\n\n# Now you can use these references to access the numpy arrays in a zero-copy manner\n```\n\nWhen working with numpy arrays directly, you can use `ray.put()` to store the array in the object store and pass its reference to your Ray tasks. This way, the task can access the array in a read-only, zero-copy manner.\n\n```python\narray = np.zeros((100, 100))\narray_ref = ray.put(array)\n\n@ray.remote\ndef f(array_ref):\n    array = ray.get(array_ref)\n    # Now you can work with the array in a zero-copy manner\n\n# Call the remote function with the array reference\nf.remote(array_ref)\n```\n\nRemember that if you need to mutate the numpy array, you will need to copy it into the local process memory first, as the zero-copy feature only works with read-only objects.",

Unique name: Actors can be given a unique name within their namespace, allowing them to be retrieved from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Get-or-create: Ray provides a `get_if_exists` option for actor creation that creates an actor only if it doesn\u2019t exist.\n3. Namespace: Named actors are scoped by namespace. If no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.\n4. Detached actors: Actors can be detached, meaning they will live as global objects independent of the creator.\n\nNamed actors can be useful if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it, or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver. However, if you don\u2019t need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.",

Here is an example of how to configure `FailureConfig`:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Create a FailureConfig object\nconfig = tune.FailureConfig(max_retries=3)\n\n# Use the FailureConfig object when creating the Tuner\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, failure_config=config)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `max_retries` parameter is set to 3, which means that if a trial fails, it will be retried up to 3 times before it is considered a failure.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` callbacks to customize the behavior when a trial fails or is recovered. These callbacks are called after a trial instance has failed or is scheduled for retry, respectively.\n\nFor example, you can use the `on_trial_error` callback to log the error or save the trial state before the trial is retried:\n\n```python\nclass MyCallback(tune.Callback):\n    def on_trial_error(self, iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n        # Log the error\n        print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} failed with error: {info['error']}\")\n\n        # Save the trial state\n        tune.run(train_model, trial_space, callbacks=[MyCallback()], checkpoint_at_end=True)\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, callbacks=[MyCallback()])\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyCallback` class defines the `on_trial_error` method, which is called when a trial fails. The method logs the error and saves the trial state using the `tune.run` function with the `checkpoint_at_end` parameter set to `True`. This will save the trial state to a checkpoint file after the trial has finished.",

However, Ray Tuner does not provide a direct way to limit memory usage. You can try to limit memory usage by specifying a custom resource for memory and setting a limit on the number of trials that can use that resource.\n\nHere's an example of how to set a custom resource for memory and limit the number of trials that can use it:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune.resources import Resources\n\n# Set the memory limit to 4GB\nmemory_limit = 4 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024\n\n# Create a custom resource for memory\nray.init(resources={\"memory\": memory_limit})\n\n# Define the trainable function with the custom resource\ndef trainable(config):\n    # Request 1 CPU and the custom memory resource\n    tune.with_resources(train_model, {\"cpu\": 1, \"memory\": memory_limit})\n\n# Define the TuneConfig with max_concurrent_trials set to the number of trials that can use the custom memory resource\ntune_config = TuneConfig(\n    num_samples=100,\n    max_concurrent_trials=ray.cluster_resources().get(\"memory\") // memory_limit,\n    resources_per_trial={\"memory\": memory_limit}\n)\n\n# Create the Tuner with the TuneConfig\ntuner = tune.Tuner(trainable, tune_config=tune_config)\n\n# Run the Tuner\ntuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, we set the memory limit to 4GB and create a custom resource for memory with that limit. We then define the trainable function with the custom resource and set the `resources_per_trial` parameter in the `TuneConfig` to the custom memory resource. Finally, we set `max_concurrent_trials` to the number of trials that can use the custom memory resource based on the cluster resources.\n\nNote that this approach does not guarantee that the memory limit will not be exceeded, as it is up to the user to ensure that the memory limit is not exceeded in their trainable function.",

            "generated_answer": " To get the actor ID of the current process in Ray, you can use the `get_actor_id()` function from `ray.runtime_context.RuntimeContext`. This function returns the current actor ID in hex format as an optional string. If there's no actor ID, it returns None. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray.runtime_context import RuntimeContext\n\nactor_id = RuntimeContext.get_actor_id()\nprint(actor_id)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `actor_id` property from `ray.runtime_context.RuntimeContext`, which has the same functionality as `get_actor_id()`. However, note that this property is deprecated and may be removed in future Ray releases. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray.runtime_context import RuntimeContext\n\nactor_id = RuntimeContext.actor_id\nprint(actor_id)\n```\nOnce you have the actor ID, you can use the `get_actor()` function from `ray.util.state` to get more information about the actor, such as its state, class name, job ID, and node ID. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray.util.state import get_actor\n\nactor_info = get_actor(id=actor_id)\nprint(actor_info)\n```\nYou can also use the `ray logs actor` command to view the logs of the actor with the given ID. Here's an example:\n```bash\nray logs actor --id <ACTOR_ID>\n```\nReplace `<ACTOR_ID>` with the actual actor ID you want to view the logs for.",

However, there is no direct function for all\\_reduce in the provided context. Instead, you can create a custom actor with a method that performs the all\\_reduce operation using `ray.util.collective.reduce` and `ray.util.collective.barrier`. Here's an example:\n\n1. Define a custom actor:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass AllReduceActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = None\n\n    def allreduce(self, tensor):\n        ray.util.collective.barrier(\"allreduce_group\")\n        reduced_tensor = ray.util.collective.reduce(tensor, 0, \"allreduce_group\")\n        ray.util.collective.barrier(\"allreduce_group\")\n        self.data = reduced_tensor\n        return self.data\n```\n\n2. Create the actor and perform allreduce:\n\n```python\nactor = AllReduceActor.remote()\n\n# Perform allreduce on a list of tensors\ntensors = [torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])]\n\nresults = ray.get([actor.allreduce.remote(tensor) for tensor in tensors])\n\nprint(results)  # [tensor([5., 7., 9.]), tensor([5., 7., 9.])]\n```\n\nIn this example, `allreduce_group` is the name of the collective group. You need to ensure that all actors and tasks that participate in the allreduce operation are part of this group. You can create a group by passing its name to the `ray.util.collective.barrier` function when initializing the actors and tasks.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simple example, and you might need to adjust it based on your specific use case.",

The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\n# kill the actor\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\nNote that this will not go through the normal Python teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` will not be called. Also, subsequent calls to get the actor's handle via `ray.get_actor()` will fail.\n\nFor detached actors, you can also call `ray.kill()` on an actor handle to destroy the actor and allow the name to be reused.\n\nIf you want to let pending tasks finish before killing the actor, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any exit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nIf you're using C++, you can use the `actor_handle.Kill()` method to kill the actor forcefully. This will cause the actor to immediately exit its process, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a `RayActorError`. If you would like Ray to automatically restart the actor, make sure to set a nonzero `max_restarts` in the `@ray.remote` options for the actor, then pass the flag `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill()`.",

            "generated_answer": " To add logging inside an actor, you can define a log method within the actor class that uses the logging library to add a message to the actor's log. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport logging\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        self.logger.info(msg)\n\n# create an instance of the actor and call the log method\nactor = MyActor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\nBy default, all stdout and stderr of tasks and actors are redirected to the driver output. To customize prefixes for actor logs, you can define the `__repr__` method for the actor class to replace the actor name with a custom representation.\n\nYou can also modify the logging level for different Ray loggers, such as `ray.data`, `ray.tune`, `ray.rllib`, `ray.train`, and `ray.serve`, using the `logging.getLogger()` and `setLevel()` methods. Here's an example:\n```python\nray_data_logger = logging.getLogger(\"ray.data\")\nray_data_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n```\nThis will set the logging level for the `ray.data` logger to `WARNING`, so only messages with a level of `WARNING` or higher will be logged.\n\nFinally, you can mount the Ray log directory to a volume in the Ray container's configuration to access the log files outside of the container. Here's an example:\n```yaml\nvolumeMounts:\n  - mountPath: /tmp/ray\n    name: ray-logs\n```\nThis will mount the Ray log directory to the `/tmp/ray` directory in the container.",

You will need to replace `your-bucket-name` and `your-checkpoint-path` with the appropriate values for your setup. Similarly, you will need to replace `s3://your-bucket-name/your-text-data-path` and `s3://your-bucket-name/your-output-path` with the appropriate S3 paths for your input text data and output data.\n\nThe script uses Ray's `map_batches()` function to apply the `infer_batch()` function to each batch of text data in the Ray Data object. The `infer_batch()` function tokenizes the input text using the GPT-2 tokenizer, gets predictions from the GPT-2 model, and extracts the predicted labels. The resulting Ray Data object contains both the input text and the predicted labels. Finally, the script saves the results to an S3 bucket using the `write_parquet()` function.\n\nNote that this script uses a single Ray worker to perform the batch inference. If you have access to multiple Ray workers, you can modify the script to use Ray's `ActorPoolStrategy` to parallelize the batch inference across multiple workers.",

For example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers.trainer_callback import TrainerCallback\n\nclass MyTrainReportCallback(TrainerCallback):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.metrics = {}\n\n    def on_train_begin(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n        # do something at the beginning of training\n        pass\n\n    def on_train_end(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n        # do something at the end of training\n        pass\n\n    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, args, state, **kwargs):\n        # do something at the beginning of each epoch\n        pass\n\n    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, args, state, **kwargs):\n        # do something at the end of each epoch\n        pass\n\n    def on_step_begin(self, step, args, state, **kwargs):\n        # do something at the beginning of each step\n        pass\n\n    def on_step_end(self, step, args, state, **kwargs):\n        # do something at the end of each step\n        pass\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    callbacks=[MyTrainReportCallback()],\n)\n```\n\nYou can then use the methods of your custom callback class to implement the desired behavior at the various stages of training.",

Push a new actor to the ActorPool:\n```python\nnew_actor = MyActor.remote()\npool.push(new_actor)\n```\n4. Now you can use the `new_actor` instance to call the `get_data()` method:\n```python\nprint(ray.get(new_actor.get_data.remote()))\n```\n\nThis will print:\n```\nHello, Ray!\n```\n\nBy pushing the new actor to the ActorPool, you can reuse the existing connection and resources, which can improve performance and resource utilization.",

The context suggests that you can use the Ray CLI to launch a cluster with a configuration file, like so:\n\n```bash\nray up -y config.yaml\n```\n\nIf you need to specify a subnet, you might need to configure your AWS environment accordingly before using the Ray CLI. For example, you can set up a VPC with a specific subnet configuration in AWS, and then use the Ray CLI to launch the cluster. This way, the Ray cluster will be launched within the pre-configured VPC and subnets.\n\nAdditionally, the context suggests using the Ray cluster launcher with the AWS Python SDK (Boto3). You can configure Boto3 with your AWS credentials and specify the desired subnets in your AWS environment. After configuring Boto3, you can use the Ray cluster launcher to launch the Ray cluster, which will then use the specified subnets.\n\nIn summary, to specify a subnet for a Ray cluster in AWS, configure your AWS environment with the desired VPC and subnets, and then use the Ray CLI or Ray cluster launcher to launch the Ray cluster within that environment.

This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\nHere's an example:\n```python\nimport os\nimport ray\n\n# Set environment variable to disable changing working directory\nos.environ[\"RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR\"] = \"0\"\n\n# Save local file to working directory\nwith open(\"local_file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    with open(os.path.join(ray.workdir, \"stored_file.txt\"), \"w\") as g:\n        g.write(f.read())\n```",

            "question": "what doess the GCS server do, and why is my GCS server taking up so much memory on the head node?",
            "generated_answer": " The GCS server, or Global Control Service, is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster that runs on the Ray head node. It manages node membership and actor directory, and provides cluster-level operations including actor, placement groups, and node management. However, by default, the GCS is not fault tolerant, meaning that its failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\nThe reason why your GCS server may be taking up so much memory on the head node is because the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it, such as GCS and the API server. This is in addition to the system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and the driver that runs from the head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of tasks and actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems.\n\nTo alleviate this, you can consider not running any tasks and actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node by ray start --head. If you use Kuberay, you can also view the documentation on how to configure the head node hardware specification based on metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth usage. Additionally, you can tune operating system settings to support the number of connections made by all nodes and workers connecting to the GCS.",

Check the status of your Ray cluster by running `ray status`. This will give you an overview of the nodes in your cluster and their status.\n2. Look for any recent failures or pending nodes in the output of `ray status`. If there are any pending nodes, it could be an indication that there are not enough resources available to launch the nodes.\n3. If you are using Kubernetes, you can check the status of your pods by running `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`. This will give you more information about any errors that might be preventing the pods from starting.\n4. You can also try increasing the resources available to your cluster by modifying the YAML file used to create the cluster. This might involve adding more nodes or increasing the amount of CPU or memory available to each node.\n5. If you are using Ray Tune with Kubernetes, you can try using shared storage for checkpoints to avoid performance bottlenecks caused by synchronization across nodes.\n6. If you are still having trouble, you can try restarting the cluster by running `ray up`. This will restart all Ray services and reapply any filemounts and setup commands.\n\nIt's also worth noting that running multiple Ray Tune jobs on the same cluster at the same time is not officially supported and can lead to competition for resources.

For example, to take the first 10 rows, you can use `train_dataset.take(10)`. If you want to take a random subset, you can use the `sample` method with the `replace=False` argument to get a fixed-size sample without replacement. For example, to take a random sample of 10 rows, you can use `train_dataset.sample(10, replace=False)`. Note that the `sample` method returns a new Ray Dataset, while the `take` method returns a list of rows.",

            "generated_answer": " To get the ID of the head node in a Ray cluster, you can use the `get_node` function from `ray.util.state` and specify the ID of the head node. The ID of the head node can be obtained by running `scontrol show hostnames \"$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST\"` in the head node, which will return the list of node names in the cluster. The first node in the list is the head node.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `RuntimeContext.get_node_id` function to get the ID of the node that the current worker or driver is running on. This will return the ID of the head node if the worker or driver is running on the head node.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `get_node` to get the ID of the head node:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import get_node\n\n# Get the ID of the head node\nhead_node_id = ray.global_state.node_ids[0]\n\n# Get the NodeState object for the head node\nhead_node = get_node(head_node_id)\n\n# Print the ID and IP address of the head node\nprint(\"Head node ID:\", head_node.node_id)\nprint(\"Head node IP:\", head_node.node_manager_address)\n```\nHere is an example of how to use `RuntimeContext.get_node_id` to get the ID of the head node:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.runtime_context import RuntimeContext\n\n# Get the ID of the node that the current worker or driver is running on\nnode_id = RuntimeContext.get_node_id()\n\n# If the current worker or driver is running on the head node, the node ID will be the ID of the head node\nif node_id in ray.global_state.node_ids:\n    print(\"Head node ID:\", node_id)\n```\nNote that the `get_node` function returns a `NodeState` object, which contains information about the node such as its ID, IP address, and resources. The `RuntimeContext.get_node_id` function returns the ID of the node as a string.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the `node_id` is a unique identifier for the raylet, which is a process that manages resources on a node in a Ray cluster. The raylet is responsible for allocating resources to tasks and actors, and for managing the lifecycle of those tasks and actors. The `node_id` is used to identify the raylet and the node that it is running on.\n\nAdditionally, the `NodeID` is a unique identifier for the raylet, `alive` is a boolean indicating whether the node is still alive, `NodeManagerAddress` is the private IP of the node that the raylet is on, and `Resources` is the total resource capacity on the node.\n\nFinally, the `--node-ip-address` and `--address` are command line options that can be used when starting a Ray cluster. `--node-ip-address` is used to specify the externally-available address of the head node, which is used by worker nodes to connect to the head node. `--address` is used to specify the address of the head node when starting a worker node, so that the worker node knows where to connect to.",

Additionally, there might be other processes using most of the CPUs, causing the tuner to use a small amount. A common issue is PyTorch, which appears to be using all the cores and needs `torch.set_num_threads(1)` to avoid contention. Another reason could be that the Ray cluster does not have any available CPUs for the Data job to run on, causing it to hang. To ensure CPU resources are always available for Ray Data execution, limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the `max_concurrent_trials` Tune option.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

            "generated_answer": " To avoid objects not getting spilled, you can use NVMe SSDs or other high-performance storage for Ray's temporary directory. By default, Ray spills objects to the local filesystem's temporary directory when the object store is full. You can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `ray.init()` function. Additionally, using multiple directories for spilling can help spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices.\n\nHere's an example of how to configure the spilling directory:\n```python\nimport json\nimport ray\n\nray.init(\n    _system_config={\n        \"object_spilling_config\": json.dumps(\n            {\n                \"type\": \"filesystem\",\n                \"params\": {\"directory_path\": \"/tmp/spill\"},\n            }\n        )\n    },\n)\n```\nTo avoid bottlenecks, it's recommended to avoid passing large objects as values in the search space, as that will incur a performance overhead. Instead, use `tune.with_parameters` to pass large objects in or load them inside your trainable from disk or cloud storage.\n\nAdditionally, if you're using an HDD, it's recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

The `no_restart=True` argument ensures that the replica is not automatically restarted after being killed.\n\nYou can find the name of the replica by listing all actors with the `ray list actors` command, and filtering by the class name of the replica. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ ray list actors --filter \"class_name=ServeReplica:SleepyPid\"\n```\n\nThis will show you a list of all replicas with the class name `ServeReplica:SleepyPid`, along with their names and states.
