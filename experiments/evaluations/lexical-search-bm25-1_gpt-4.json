The Ray autoscaler, a process that runs on the head node, increases or decreases the number of worker nodes in the cluster when the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed or are below the current capacity. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When Ray Serve scales down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that allows the Ray autoscaler to remove nodes with no Ray actors or tasks running on them. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler, requesting the start of a number of replica actors based on the request demand.",

The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

In the context you provided, it looks like the logs are being stored in `~/ray_results`. Therefore, you can start TensorBoard by running the command `tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results`.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that only the results from the rank 0 worker will be used for logging. To aggregate results from multiple workers, you can use Ray Train's `train.report()` function to report metrics from the training function on distributed workers. These results will be collected from the distributed workers and passed to the driver to be logged and displayed.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the training function to report metrics using Ray Train's `train.report()` function:\n\n```\nimport ray\n\ndef train_func():\n    # Initialize Ray Train\n    train = ray.train.Train()\n\n    batch_size = 64\n    single_worker_dataset = mnist_dataset(batch_size)\n    single_worker_model = build_and_compile_cnn_model()\n\n    for epoch in range(epochs):\n        tf_dataset = single_worker_dataset.to_tf(\n            feature_columns=\"x\", label_columns=\"y\", batch_size=batch_size\n        )\n\n        history = single_worker_model.fit(\n            tf_dataset, callbacks=[ReportCheckpointCallback()], epochs=3, steps_per_epoch=70\n        )\n\n        # Report metrics\n        train.report(metrics={\"loss\": history.history[\"loss\"][-1]})\n\n    return history.history\n```\n\nIn this example, the `train.report()` function is called after each epoch to report the loss metric.

However, the context provided does not contain any specific details about the issue you are facing.\n\nHere are some general steps you can follow to debug deadlocks in Ray:\n\n1. Check if there are any pending tasks or actors that cannot be scheduled by running `ray status`. If there are, you may need to increase the number of available CPUs or GPUs in your Ray cluster.\n2. Use the `ray profiler` to identify any performance bottlenecks or resource contention issues.\n3. Check if any of your custom code or user-defined functions are causing the deadlock. You can use Python's built-in debugging tools such as `pdb` or `print` statements to inspect the state of your program at various points in time.\n4. If you are using Ray's `rollout_worker` module, make sure that you are creating and destroying workers correctly. You can refer to the `RolloutWorker` class documentation in the Ray RLlib library for more information on how to use this module.\n5. If none of the above steps help, you can try creating a minimal, reproducible example that demonstrates the deadlock and post it on the Ray community forum or GitHub repository for further assistance.",

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

A deployment consists of a number of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the incoming request load. You can define a deployment using the `@serve.deployment` decorator on a Python class or function.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\n@serve.deployment\nclass MyDeployment:\n    def __init__(self, name: str):\n        self._name = name\n\n    def __call__(self, request):\n        return \"Hello world!\"\n\napp = MyDeployment.bind()\nserve.run(app)\n```\nThis creates a deployment named \"MyDeployment\" with one replica. Requests to this deployment will call the `__call__` method on the class.\n\nYou can also configure a deployment to scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\nThe `Deployment.create` method creates a deployment object and `Deployment.deploy` deploys the object in the instance of Ray Serve with the specified number of replicas.\n\nFor example:\n```\ndeployment = Serve.deployment() \\\n    .setName(\"strategy\") \\\n    .setDeploymentDef(StrategyOnRayServe.class.getName()) \\\n    .setNumReplicas(4) \\\n    .create()\ndeployment.deploy(true)\n```\nThis creates a deployment named \"strategy\" with 4 replicas.\n\nYou can also deploy a Ray Serve application to production on a Ray cluster using the Ray Serve CLI. The `serve deploy` command takes in a config file path and deploys that file to a Ray cluster over HTTP.

You can use it by updating the user\\_config when creating a deployment or by triggering the reconfigure method of the deployment. The reconfigure method can be triggered by updating the Serve config file with a new user\\_config and reapplying it to the Ray cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to use user config in Ray Serve:\n\n1. Deploy the graph:\n```arduino\n$ ray start --head\n$ serve deploy fruit_config.yaml\n```\n2. Trigger the reconfigure method by updating the Serve config file with a new user\\_config:\n```yaml\n...\ndeployments:\n    - name: Model\n      user_config:\n        threshold: 1.5\n```\n3. Reapply the updated config to the Ray cluster.\n\nThe user\\_config allows you to update the deployments without having to recreate them, which can be useful for making lightweight updates to your Ray Serve application.",
            "reference_answer": "User config in Ray Serve is a configuration that you can pass to the reconfigure method of the deployment. This configuration can be updated dynamically without restarting the replicas of the deployment. The user_config must be fully JSON-serializable. You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument. You can also trigger the reconfigure method by updating your Serve config file with a new user_config and reapplying it to your Ray cluster.",

Provides Get-Or-Create functionality for actor creation, where a handle to the actor will be returned if it already exists, and a new actor will be created with the specified arguments if it doesn't.\n4. Supports non-global named actors in C++, where the actor name is only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.\n5. Named actors are scoped by namespace, and if no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.\n\nIn summary, named actors provide a way to access and manage actors in a more flexible and decoupled manner within a Ray cluster.",

Here is an example of a function that takes a batch of dictionaries and returns a list of dictionaries with the same keys and values multiplied by 2:\n\n```python\ndef map_fn(batch: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:\n    return [{'id': d['id'] * 2} for d in batch]\n\nds = ray.data.from_items([{'id': i} for i in range(10)])\nds_out = ds.map_batches(map_fn, batch_size=5)\n```\n\nIn this example, `map_fn` takes a list of dictionaries with a single key `'id'` and returns a list of dictionaries with the same key and value multiplied by 2.

However, these settings control the length of evaluation episodes and not training episodes.\n\nUnfortunately, RLlib does not directly support setting a maximum episode length for training episodes. Instead, you can implement this functionality in your custom environment by terminating the episode when the desired length is reached.\n\nHere's an example of how to terminate an episode in a custom OpenAI Gym environment:\n\n```python\nclass MyCustomEnv(gym.Env):\n    def __init__(self, max_episode_length):\n        self.max_episode_length = max_episode_length\n\n    def step(self, action):\n        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = super().step(action)\n        if truncated or terminated:\n            return observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info\n        if self.step_num >= self.max_episode_length:\n            terminated = True\n            reward = -10  # negative reward for terminating the episode early\n        self.step_num += 1\n        return observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info\n```\n\nIn this example, the `step_num` attribute keeps track of the current step number in the episode. When the step number reaches the `max_episode_length`, the `terminated` flag is set to `True`, and the episode is terminated. You can adjust the `reward` value to provide appropriate feedback to the agent for terminating the episode early.",

However, the provided context does not include information on how to set up `FailureConfig`. Instead, it suggests using the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` functions.\n\nThe `on_trial_error` function is called after a trial instance fails, while `on_trial_recover` is called after a trial instance fails but is scheduled for retry. You can define custom behavior in these functions to handle trial failures and retries.\n\nTo set up trial retries, you can use the following example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import tune\n\ndef on_trial_error(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    # Implement custom behavior for trial failure here\n    pass\n\ndef on_trial_recover(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    # Implement custom behavior for trial recovery here\n    pass\n\nray.tune.register_callback(on_trial_error)\nray.tune.register_callback(on_trial_recover)\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, callbacks=[on_trial_error, on_trial_recover])\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `on_trial_error` and `on_trial_recover` functions are registered as callbacks, and then passed to the `Tuner` constructor. This will ensure that the callbacks are invoked when a trial fails or is scheduled for retry. You can implement custom behavior for trial failure and recovery in these functions.\n\nHowever, if you want to configure trial retries using `FailureConfig`, you can refer to the Ray Tune documentation for more information on how to set it up.",

To avoid unnecessary blocking, it's recommended to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get` and work with object references directly instead.",

You can then use ray.get() to fetch the result of a remote object from the object reference. If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object. You can also set a timeout to return early from a get that's blocking for too long.

If you're working with tabular data, consider using Ray Data preprocessors, which implement common data preprocessing operations.\n4. For unstructured data, use Ray Data operations like `map_batches`.\n\nRemember that Ray Data is designed for deep learning applications that involve both CPU preprocessing and GPU inference, allowing you to utilize both sets of resources concurrently and reducing overall cost.\n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the Ray Data User Guides and the Ray Train User Guides.",

For example, to upgrade the `certifi` package to version `2022.2.1`, you can do:\n```\nRuntimeEnv(\n    pip={\"packages\": [\"certifi==2022.2.1\"], \"pip_check\": False, \"pip_version\": \"==22.0.2;python_version=='3.8.11'\"}\n)\n```\nThis will install `certifi` version `2022.2.1` in the runtime environment, even if an older version of the package is already installed. Note that you will need to replace `'3.8.11'` with the version of Python that you are using.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `--force-reinstall` option when installing the package with pip to force reinstall the package, even if it is already installed:\n```\nRuntimeEnv(\n    pip={\"packages\": [\"certifi==2022.2.1\"], \"pip_check\": False, \"pip_options\": [\"--force-reinstall\"]}\n)\n```\nThis will force reinstall the `certifi` package, even if it is already installed.\n\nKeep in mind that force upgrading a package can potentially lead to compatibility issues with other packages that depend on the older version of the package.

To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required, which stores the data in Redis instance and allows the GCS to resume regular functions when it restarts.\n\nIf you want to run memory profiling on the GCS server, you can use Jemalloc and set the environment variables RAY\\_JEMALLOC\\_LIB\\_PATH and RAY\\_JEMALLOC\\_CONF.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and the driver runs from a head node by default.

If the head node is out of date or if there are not enough available resources in the cluster, consider terminating the out-of-date node and provisioning a new one, or adding more nodes to the cluster.\n4.

            "generated_answer": " To track an uncaught exception in a Ray Serve application, you can use post-mortem debugging. This involves automatically dropping into the debugger when an exception is thrown. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. Install the required dependencies:\n```\npip install \"ray[serve]\" scikit-learn\n```\n2. Create a file called `serve_debugging.py` and include the following code:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray import serve\n\nserve.start()\n```\n\n3. Add a function that raises an exception.\n\n4. Run the Ray Serve application with the `--logging-level` flag set to `debug`:\n\n```bash\nray serve --logging-level debug serve_debugging.py\n```\n\n5. When an uncaught exception occurs, Ray Serve will print the traceback in the logs, allowing you to track and debug the issue.\n\nAdditionally, when a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a `RayTaskError`. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result. You can catch these exceptions in your application code to handle them appropriately.",

            "generated_answer": " To set environment variables in `ray.init()`, you can include the `env_vars` option in the `runtime_env` argument. For example, to set the `foo` environment variable to the value `\"foo\"`, you can do:\n\n```python\nray.init(\n    runtime_env={\n        \"working_dir\": \"files/my_project\",\n        \"pip\": [\"toolz\", \"requests\"],\n        \"env_vars\": {\"foo\": \"foo\"},\n    },\n)\n```\n\nThe `env_vars` option is a dictionary of environment variables to set. Environment variables already set on the cluster will still be visible to the Ray workers; so there is no need to include `os.environ` or similar in the `env_vars` field. By default, these environment variables override the same name environment variables on the cluster. You can also reference existing environment variables using `${ENV_VAR}` to achieve the appending behavior. If the environment variable doesn\u2019t exist, it becomes an empty string `\"\"`.\n\nIn your specific case, you can modify the `ray.init()` call in your context as follows:\n\n```python\nray.init(\n    runtime_env={\n        \"working_dir\": \"files/my_project\",\n        \"pip\": [\"toolz\", \"requests\"],\n        \"env_vars\": {\"foo\": \"foo\"},\n    },\n    namespace=\"my_namespace\",\n    address=\"ray://1.2.3.4:10001\",\n)\n```\n\nThis will set the `foo` environment variable to the value `\"foo\"` for the Ray workers created by this `ray.init()` call.",

To reserve extra resource slots, you can use `tune.with_resources` with a `tune.PlacementGroupFactory` that specifies the required resources for each bundle. Additionally, if one process is using most of the CPUs and the others are using a small amount, this may also be the problem. It's also possible that Ray is not scheduling more tasks in parallel than the number of CPUs, or that there are not enough available CPUs for Ray Data to run on.

Here are the steps:\n\n1. Install miniforge.\n2. Ensure you're using the miniforge environment.\n3. Install Ray as you normally would using pip.\n\nHowever, note that the function `use_gpu()` defined above doesn't actually use any GPUs. To use GPUs, you need to install the GPU version of TensorFlow and modify the function to use TensorFlow's GPU capabilities.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    if tf.test.gpu_device_name():\n        print('Default GPU Device: {}'.format(tf.test.gpu_device_name()))\n    else:\n        print(\"Please install GPU version of TF\")\n```\n\nTo avoid bottlenecks and develop and test Tune locally, you can configure search spaces, use large datasets, and continue training a completed Tune experiment for longer and with new configurations. You can also use multi-tenancy to run multiple Ray Tune jobs on the same cluster at the same time.\n\nTo make your Tune experiments reproducible, you can set the random seed and use the same version of dependencies. To upload your Tune results to cloud storage, you can use the `ray.tune.report()` function to log results and use a Ray Serve or a custom HTTP server to retrieve the results.\n\nTo use Tune with Docker or Kubernetes, you can follow the Ray documentation to set up a Ray cluster and use Tune with Docker or Kubernetes.\n\nTo access relative filepaths in your Tune training function, you can use the `os.path.join()` function to combine the relative path with the current working directory.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, you can refer to the Ray documentation or ask for help on the Ray community Slack channel.",

Get the node ID / node IP from `ray list nodes`\n2. Use the following command to list logs:\n```python\nfrom ray.util.state import list_logs\nlist_logs(node_id=<HEAD_NODE_ID>)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray logs` command with the `--node-id` flag to list logs for a specific node.\n\nIf you need to access logs for a dead node, you should store and persist logs to inspect them after the clusters are stopped or terminated.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

By default, objects are spilled to Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold.

            "generated_answer": " To kill a specific serve replica, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Get the actor handle for the replica you want to kill using `ray.get_actor()`. You can get the name of the replica from the output of `ray list actors`.\n2. Use `ray.kill()` to kill the replica, passing in the actor handle and setting `no_restart=True` to prevent the replica from automatically restarting.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Get the actor handle for the replica you want to kill\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\n\n# Kill the replica\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\n\nWhile the replica is restarted, the other replicas can continue processing requests. Eventually, the replica will restart and continue serving requests.",
