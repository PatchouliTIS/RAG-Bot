            "generated_answer": "When using Ray Data's `map_batches` method, you can configure the batch type by specifying the `batch_format` parameter. By default, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays. However, you can also configure it to represent batches as pandas DataFrames.\n\nTo avoid potential out-of-memory situations, it is important to ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large. Additionally, when calling `map_batches`, make sure to choose a batch size that is small enough for the output batch to comfortably fit into memory.\n\nHere's an example of how to configure the batch format using NumPy:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n```\n\nIn this example, the `increase_brightness` function takes a batch represented as a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays and increases the brightness of the \"image\" array. You can return the modified batch in the same format.\n\nYou can find more information about batch format configuration and other details in the Ray Data documentation, specifically the `ray.data.Dataset.map_batches` and `ray.data.preprocessors.BatchMapper` sections.",

You can return either format from your function. If you're dealing with NumPy datasets, your function manipulates the specific numpy dataset. For instance, in the provided example, `increase_brightness` function increases the brightness of an image. Similarly, if you're dealing with pandas DataFrame, you can perform operations like dropping NaN values from the DataFrame using your function. It's vital that the functions are correctly formatted and the intended operation is properly performed in these functions.",

            "generated_answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the application's load. The autoscaling feature in Ray Serve is built on top of the Ray Autoscaler.\n\nWhen the demand for requests increases, the Ray Serve autoscaler asks Ray to start a number of replica actors. If there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider, which responds by adding more nodes.\n\nThe Ray Autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed the current capacity of the cluster, the autoscaler tries to increase the number of worker nodes. Conversely, when worker nodes are idle, the autoscaler removes them from the cluster.\n\nTo configure autoscaling in Ray, you can use the Ray cluster launcher or configure the Ray autoscaler on Kubernetes using the Ray autoscaler process. The autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in Ray Serve works with the help of a demand-based replica autoscaler which responds to traffic spikes by evaluating the size of the queue and determining whether more or less replicas are needed. This can be configured by setting the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The 'min_replicas' and 'max_replicas' fields determine the range of replicas that can be deployed, with deployments starting with 'initial_replicas'. The 'target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica' configures how aggressively the autoscaler responds to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler uses the Ray Autoscaler, and the number of replica actors based on the request demand are started by ray. If there's not enough CPUs to support these actors, Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the cloud provider, which can add more nodes. Similarly, when Ray Serve scales down and ends some replica actors, it attempts to do so in a manner which results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, in which case, the Ray Autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Here's a comparison of these frameworks based on the provided context:\n\n1. Spark: Apache Spark is a widely used distributed data processing framework that provides a unified analytics engine for big data processing. It supports batch processing, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. Spark has a rich ecosystem and provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It is known for its fault tolerance, scalability, and ease of use.\n\n2. Ray: Ray is a fast and flexible distributed execution framework primarily designed for high-performance computing and machine learning workloads. It provides a simple and efficient way to parallelize Python applications and supports task-based parallelism. Ray is well-suited for GPU workloads and deep learning inference. It also offers fault tolerance and automatic scaling.\n\n3. Dask: Dask is a Python parallel computing library that focuses on scaling analytics and scientific computing workloads. It provides parallel versions of familiar Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas, allowing them to handle larger-than-memory datasets and run operations on multi-machine clusters. Dask offers automatic data parallelism, smart scheduling, and optimized operations through a task graph execution model.\n\nIn terms of integration, there are projects like Dask-on-Ray and Spark on Ray (RayDP) that aim to combine the capabilities of these frameworks. Dask-on-Ray allows using Dask and Ray libraries together in the same application, while Spark on Ray (RayDP) combines Spark and Ray clusters to enable large-scale data processing using the PySpark API.\n\nIt's important to note that Dask-on-Ray is an ongoing project and may not achieve the same performance as using Ray directly. However, Dask abstractions should run seamlessly on top of Ray using this scheduler.\n\nFor a more detailed performance comparison between Ray and Apache Spark, especially for GPU workloads, you can refer to the provided context on \"Ray Data\" and \"Apache Spark.\"\n\nOverall, the choice between Spark, Ray, and Dask depends on the specific requirements of your use case, the nature of your workloads, and the ecosystem and APIs you are most comfortable with.",

            "generated_answer": "Ray may overload a node with more tasks than the resources allow due to a few reasons. One reason is that tasks or actors may use more than their proportionate share of memory, which can lead to issues like Out of Memory (OOM) errors. In such cases, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them. Ray ensures that the sum of the resource requirements of all concurrently running tasks and actors on a node does not exceed the node's total resources.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the resource requirements of tasks or actors do not impose limits on actual physical resource usage. For example, Ray does not prevent a task with a resource requirement of num_cpus=1 from launching multiple threads and using multiple physical CPUs. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that tasks or actors do not use more resources than specified via resource requirements. Ray also does not provide CPU isolation for tasks or actors, meaning it won't reserve a physical CPU exclusively for a task with num_cpus=1.\n\nIn the context of a data processing workload, running too many tasks concurrently can cause OOM issues. In this case, the memory resource can be used to limit the number of concurrently running tasks. The memory resource requirement is logical, meaning Ray will not enforce the physical memory usage of each task if it exceeds the specified amount.\n\nIt's important to understand that Ray does not provide strong resource isolation, which means simultaneous jobs can interfere with each other and make them less reliable to run in production. Ray also does not support priorities or access control for jobs, tasks, and actors.\n\nBy default, Ray nodes start with pre-defined CPU, GPU, and memory resources. The quantities of these resources on each node are set to the physical quantities auto-detected by Ray. However, it's worth noting that Ray does not permit dynamic updates of resource capacities after Ray has been started on a node.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray could overload a node with more tasks than the resources allow because Ray resources are logical, not physical. This means they don't impose limits on actual physical resource usage. While Ray provides mechanisms for scheduling tasks based on specified resource requirements, it doesn't prevent tasks from using resources beyond those specified. The responsibility of ensuring tasks or actors use no more resources than specified lies with the user. Furthermore, Ray doesn't provide CPU isolation for tasks or actors and the operating system is responsible for task scheduling and running.",

One key advantage is that Ray Serve allows you to develop and deploy your application on different machines or a Kubernetes cluster with minimal or no changes to your code. This makes it easier to get started without the need to provision and manage a Kubernetes cluster. Ray Serve also provides a Kubernetes Operator that allows you to seamlessly deploy your Ray Serve application to Kubernetes when needed.\n\nAnother advantage of Ray Serve is its support for multi-model composition using a programmable API. With Ray Serve, you can write code that calls different models, and these calls look just like regular function calls. This makes it easier to work with and provides flexibility in composing different models that can use different resources and run across different machines in the cluster.\n\nRay Serve is designed to be a general-purpose scalable serving layer and is not tied to any specific machine learning library or framework. This is important because the machine learning landscape is constantly evolving, with new libraries and model architectures being released frequently. By using Ray Serve, you can avoid locking yourself into a solution that is tied to a specific framework and have the flexibility to adapt to new technologies and frameworks as they emerge.\n\nUsing containers alone can be limiting and hard to work with, especially when it comes to serving machine learning models. Ray Serve provides a higher-level abstraction that simplifies the process of serving models and allows for easier scalability and composition of models across different machines or clusters.\n\nIn summary, Ray Serve offers ease of development and deployment, support for multi-model composition, framework independence, and scalability, making it a compelling choice for serving machine learning models compared to other frameworks like Modal or Seldon.",

Moreover, Ray Serve also offers features such as dynamic request batching, support for serving models across multiple nodes and GPUs, and resource scheduling capabilities like fractional GPUs, enabling low-cost serving of multiple ML models. On top of these, Ray Serve is particularly effective for model composition and multi-model serving, as it allows you to build complex inference services involving multiple ML models and business logic, all written in Python. Unlike other systems that require static graphs to be defined in configuration languages, Ray Serve uses a programmable API for multi-model composition, making it easier to work with and more flexible. Lastly, Ray Serve also offers automatic scaling of resources based on load and support for efficient vectorized operations via request batching, helping optimize your serving costs.",

This attribute accepts an optional `SyncConfig` object. \n\nBy default, Ray Tune uses pyarrow to perform syncing with the specified cloud storage path. However, if you want to implement custom logic for uploading/downloading from the cloud, you can pass a custom `Syncer` object to the `tune.SyncConfig` within the `air.RunConfig`.\n\nHere is an example of how to configure SyncConfig for a Ray AIR job:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.tune.syncer import SyncConfig\nfrom ray.air import RunConfig\n\n# Create a SyncConfig object with custom settings\nsync_config = SyncConfig(syncer=my_custom_syncer)\n\n# Create a RunConfig object and set the sync_config attribute\nrun_config = RunConfig(sync_config=sync_config)\n\n# Use the run_config object in your Ray AIR job\n```\n\nYou can find more details and examples of custom syncing in the Ray Tune documentation, specifically in the sections \"How can I upload my Tune results to cloud storage?\" and \"How can I use the awscli or gsutil command line commands for syncing?\"\n\nIn the provided context, it mentions that Ray AIR defaults to using pyarrow for syncing with the specified cloud storage path.

            "generated_answer": "To quickly narrow down the root cause of a failed Ray job, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the job logs: Ray applications are typically run as Ray Jobs, and the worker logs of Ray Jobs are always captured in the Ray logging directory. However, driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via the Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs using the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\n2. Accessing driver logs: If you run Ray Jobs by executing the Ray Driver on the Head node directly or connecting via Ray Client, the driver logs may not be accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can view the driver logs in your terminal or Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n3. Check task and actor logs: Task and actor logs, which are worker logs, can be accessed from the Task and Actor table view. Click the \"Log\" button to see the stdout and stderr logs that contain the output emitted from tasks and actors. For actors, you can also see the system logs for the corresponding worker process.\n\n4. Use the `ray logs` command: You can use the `ray logs` command to get logs based on the filename (cluster) or resource identifiers (actor). For example, to see the logs of a worker, you can use `ray logs worker-6f2ec5c8b0d5f5a66572859faf192d36743536c2e9702ea58084b037*out -ip 10.0.62.231`.\n\n5. Utilize the Logs view: The Logs view in the Ray Dashboard lists the Ray logs in your cluster, organized by node and log file name. It provides search functionality to help you find specific log messages. If the Ray Job is submitted by the Job API, the job logs are available from the Dashboard, following the format: `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`.\n\nBy following these steps and analyzing the relevant logs, you should be able to narrow down the root cause of a failed Ray job.",

            "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the worker node is dying due to memory pressure (OOM - Out of Memory). Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:\n\n1. Check the logs: Use the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip 172.31.183.172` to see more information about the workers killed on the node with IP 172.31.183.172. This can provide insights into the specific error messages or stack traces that might help identify the cause of the OOM error.\n\n2. Increase the number of workers: As mentioned in the warning message, consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument in the `DataLoader` initialization. The warning suggests trying a value of 64, which is the number of CPUs on the machine. Increasing the number of workers can help distribute the workload and alleviate memory pressure.\n\n3. Reduce memory consumption: Adjust the settings to reduce memory consumption. The warning message suggests that frequent cache flushes are happening, which is detrimental to performance. Consider optimizing your code or model to reduce memory usage. You can also try adding `get_accelerator().empty_cache()` calls in your training loop to ensure that all ranks flush their caches at the same time.\n\n4. Monitor memory usage: Monitor the memory usage of your worker nodes during training. You can use tools like `top` or `htop` to observe the memory usage in real-time. This can help identify any patterns or spikes in memory usage that might be causing the OOM errors.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug the OOM issue and identify the root cause of the worker node failures.",

To tolerate head node failures, it is necessary to make the Global Control Store (GCS) fault tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available.\n\n2. Raylet failure: When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated the same as a node failure. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n\n3. Temporary directory cleanup: Usually, temporary directories are cleared up whenever the machines reboot. This means that log files may get lost whenever the cluster or some of the nodes are stopped or terminated. To inspect logs after the clusters are stopped or terminated, it is necessary to store and persist the logs.\n\nIt is worth noting that killing a node and waiting for it to recover usually takes longer than killing a pod and waiting for it to recover.

When that happens, the operating system starts killing worker or raylet processes, disrupting the application. This could stall metrics and if it happens on the head node, stall the dashboard or other control processes, causing the cluster to become unusable. Ray provides a memory monitor to prevent OOM issues by periodic checking of memory usage and killing tasks or actor processes to free up memory when the combined usage exceeds a configurable threshold.

            "generated_answer": "In the context of Ray datasets, a batch and a block have different meanings.\n\nA block is a processing unit of data in Ray datasets. A dataset consists of a collection of blocks. Under the hood, Ray Data partitions rows into a set of distributed data blocks, allowing it to perform operations in parallel. Unlike a batch, which is a user-facing object, a block is an internal abstraction.\n\nOn the other hand, a batch is a user-facing object that is used in operations on Ray datasets. It is the output of functions like `map_batches()` and `iter_batches()`. A batch is a subset of rows from a block and is represented in Arrow format. It is important to note that a block determines the unit of parallelism, while a batch is a user-defined subset of data.\n\nTo avoid potential out-of-memory situations, it is recommended to ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large and to call `map_batches()` with a batch size small enough that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nOverall, blocks are internal units of data processing in Ray datasets, while batches are user-facing subsets of data used in operations.",
            "reference_answer": "In Ray datasets, a Dataset is a sequence of Ray object references to blocks. Each block holds a disjoint subset of rows, with Ray Data managing and transforming these blocks in parallel. For instance, a dataset might comprise of three blocks, each containing 1000 rows. Essentially, the Dataset is the larger structure which comprises multiple smaller structures, or blocks. Each block holds a specific portion of the data, allowing for efficient parallel operations.",

The provided context does not include the complete log messages, so it's important to examine the logs for any relevant information.\n\n2. Review the source code: Examine the source code of `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py` to understand how the rollout worker is implemented. Pay attention to any synchronization mechanisms, locks, or threading-related code that might be causing the deadlock.\n\n3. Enable debugging tools: Ray provides various debugging tools that can help identify and diagnose deadlocks. For example, you can enable the `ray.debugger` module to get more insights into the execution flow and identify potential deadlocks.\n\n4. Reproduce the issue: Try to reproduce the deadlock issue in a controlled environment. Simplify your code and configuration to isolate the problem. This will help in narrowing down the potential causes and finding a solution.\n\n5. Use logging and print statements: Insert logging statements or print statements at critical points in the code to track the execution flow and identify where the deadlock might be occurring. This can help you pinpoint the specific code section that is causing the issue.\n\n6. Analyze the data flow: Understand the data flow within the rollout worker and identify any potential bottlenecks or race conditions that could lead to deadlocks. Check if there are any shared resources or critical sections that need proper synchronization.\n\n7. Consider using debugging tools: Utilize standard debugging tools like breakpoints, stack traces, and profiling tools to analyze the state of the program during the deadlock. This can provide valuable insights into the state of the threads and help identify the root cause.\n\n8.

In such cases, you need to start the Ray cluster first using the command \"ray start\" to configure Ray.\n\nThere are three ways to start the Ray runtime: implicitly via the \"ray.init()\" function, explicitly via the command-line interface (CLI) using \"ray start\", or explicitly via the cluster launcher using \"ray up\". The Ray runtime consists of multiple services/processes that handle communication, data transfer, scheduling, and more.

            "generated_answer": "To utilize the 'zero-copy' feature provided by Ray for numpy arrays, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. When using Ray tasks, make sure to use the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the result of the task.

If you encounter a `ValueError` with the message \"assignment destination is read-only,\" you can manually copy the array at the destination before mutating it. This can be done using the `arr.copy()` method. For example:\n   ```\n   arr = arr.copy()\n   ```\n\n3. Keep in mind that manually copying the array effectively disables the zero-copy deserialization feature provided by Ray.\n\nAdditionally, Ray optimizes for numpy arrays by using Pickle protocol 5 with out-of-band data. The numpy array is stored as a read-only object, and all Ray workers on the same node can read the numpy array in the object store without copying (zero-copy reads). However, any writes to the read-only object will require you to first copy it into the local process memory.\n\nIf your function does not mutate its input, you can set `zero_copy_batch=True` to improve performance and decrease memory utilization. This can be done when calling `map_batches()` to transform your data.\n\nFor more information on working with numpy arrays and Ray, you can refer to the Ray documentation on `ray.data.Dataset.write_numpy`, `ray.data.read_numpy`, and the `compute` and `batch_format` parameters in the `ray.data` module.",

Limited scalability: Since each actor instance runs in its own process, creating a large number of singleton actors can consume a significant amount of system resources. This can limit the scalability of the system.\n\n2. Fault tolerance: Actors can fail if the actor process or the owner of the actor dies.

Named actors are particularly useful in cases where you need to create an actor only if it doesn't already exist, as demonstrated by the get_if_exists option during actor creation.\n4. Another feature provided by Ray is detaching actor lifetimes from the job, allowing an actor to persist even after the driver process of the job exits. However, this also implies that detached actors should be manually destroyed once they are no longer needed.",

            "generated_answer": "To write a map function that returns a list of objects for `map_batches`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define your custom function that takes a batch of data as input and returns a modified batch of data. Let's call this function `custom_map_function`. Make sure the function signature matches the `UserDefinedFunction[DataBatch, DataBatch]` type.\n\n2. Create an instance of the `BatchMapper` class, which applies a user-defined function to batches of a dataset. You can use this class to efficiently transform a dataset with vectorized operations.\n\n3. Initialize the `BatchMapper` object with the necessary parameters. In this case, you need to provide the `fn` parameter with your `custom_map_function`. You can also specify other optional parameters such as `batch_size`, `compute`, `batch_format`, and `zero_copy_batch` according to your requirements.\n\n4. Call the `map_batches` method on the `BatchMapper` object, passing in your custom function as the `fn` parameter. This method will apply your function to each batch of data in the dataset.\n\n5. The `map_batches` method will return a new dataset with the modified batches. You can convert this dataset to a list of objects if needed.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.data import Dataset, BatchMapper\n\ndef custom_map_function(batch):\n    # Modify the batch of data here\n    modified_batch = batch  # Replace this with your actual logic\n    return modified_batch\n\n# Create a dataset object\ndataset = Dataset(...)\n\n# Create a BatchMapper object\nbatch_mapper = BatchMapper(dataset)\n\n# Call the map_batches method with your custom function\nmodified_dataset = batch_mapper.map_batches(custom_map_function)\n\n# Convert the modified dataset to a list of objects\nmodified_list = list(modified_dataset)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `...` with the appropriate parameters and data for creating the dataset.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Move the data loader to the training function: The provided context mentions a warning about a large actor called \"TrainTrainable\". To avoid implicitly capturing large objects in scope, it is recommended to move the data loader to the training function and use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store.\n\n2. Increase the batch size: If you have access to large GPUs, you can increase the batch size to better utilize them. This can help in saturating the GPUs and potentially reduce the size of the actors.\n\n3. Use `ray.put()` to store large objects: If your actors are implicitly capturing large arrays or other objects in scope, you can use `ray.put()` to explicitly put these large objects in the Ray object store.

Ray Data provides flexible and performant APIs for distributed data processing.

You can print or use the resulting list as needed.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\na1, a2 = Actor.remote(), Actor.remote()\npool = ActorPool([a1, a2])\nresult = pool.map(lambda a, v: a.all_reduce.remote(v), [1, 2, 3, 4])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe output will be `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is the result of the `all_reduce` operation performed by each actor on the corresponding input value.",

            "generated_answer": "To cancel a job from the UI, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. If you have an ObjectRef returned by the task, you can call `ray.cancel` on it. By default, this will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel`. Refer to the API reference for `ray.cancel` for more details.\n\n2. Another option is to use the `ray.workflow.cancel` function. This function allows you to cancel a workflow by providing the workflow ID. The canceled workflow checkpoints will still be saved in storage. If you want to clean up the saved checkpoints, you can use the `workflow.delete()` function. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import workflow\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_job():\n   return 1\n\nworkflow_task = some_job.bind()\nworkflow.run(workflow_task, workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nworkflow.cancel(workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nassert workflow.get_status(\"some_job\") == workflow.CANCELED\n```\n\n3. If you want to check the current status of the job, you can use the `ray job status` command. For example:\n\n```\n$ ray job status raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW\n# Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265\n# Status for job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW': RUNNING\n# Status message: Job is currently running.\n```\n\n4. Finally, to cancel the job, you can use the `ray job stop` command. For example:\n\n```\n$ ray job stop raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW\n# Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265\n# Attempting to stop job raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW\n# Waiting for job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW' to exit (disable with --no-wait):\n# Job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW' was stopped\n```\n\nPlease note that only non-actor tasks can be canceled, and canceled tasks will not be retried.",

            "generated_answer": "Ray works with async.io by integrating natively with asyncio. This allows you to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax. With Ray, the invocation of every remote operation, such as tasks or actor methods, is asynchronous. When you invoke a remote operation, it immediately returns a promise/future, which is essentially an identifier (ID) of the operation's result. This allows the driver program to launch multiple operations in parallel, achieving parallelism.\n\nTo get the actual results of the operations, you need to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results. This call blocks until the results are available. However, it also blocks the driver program from invoking other operations, which can impact performance.\n\nIn the case of async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time, although tasks can be multiplexed. This means that only one thread is used in async actors. If you need a threadpool, you can refer to Threaded Actors.\n\nRay also enables arbitrary functions to be executed asynchronously on separate Python workers. These asynchronous functions are called \"tasks\". Ray allows tasks to specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources. The cluster scheduler then distributes these tasks across the cluster for parallelized execution.\n\nAdditionally, Ray provides the Ray Client, which allows you to interact with Ray from external processes or languages. Under the hood, Ray runs all methods inside a single Python event loop. However, it's important to note that running blocking `ray.get()` or `ray.wait()` inside async actor methods is not allowed because it will block the execution of the event loop.\n\nIn summary, Ray integrates with asyncio, allowing you to write concurrent code using async/await syntax. It provides asynchronous remote operations, such as tasks and actor methods, and allows for parallelism and resource management.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray is designed to natively integrate with asyncio, allowing for asynchronous coding alongside popular async frameworks such as aiohttp and aioredis. This is facilitated through the async/await syntax that has been available since Python 3.5. Within a Ray AsyncActor, multiple invocations of a method can run concurrently in the event loop. This allows for the execution of concurrent workload like 'await asyncio.sleep(2)' which simply results in a pause of execution for 2 seconds.

            "generated_answer": "To add logs inside an actor, you can use the `logging` module in Python. Here's an example of how to add logs inside the `Actor` class:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Basic config automatically configures logs to stream to stdout and stderr.\n        # Set the severity to INFO so that info logs are printed to stdout.\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n```\n\nIn the above code, the `Actor` class is defined with an `__init__` method that configures the logging level to `INFO`. The `log` method inside the actor uses the `logging.getLogger` function to get a logger instance and logs the provided message using `logger.info`.\n\nTo use the `log` method of the actor, you can create an instance of the actor using `Actor.remote()` and then call the `log.remote()` method to log a message. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nThis will log the message \"A log message for an actor.\" inside the actor.\n\nNote: Make sure to import the `logging` module and initialize Ray before using the actor.",
            "reference_answer": "To add log inside actor in Ray, you will initiate a driver using ray.init(). Then, when you define the Actor, you will customize the logger configuration. Begin by importing the necessary modules and initiating a driver. In the Actor class, use the basicConfig method from the logging module to configure logs to stream to stdout and stderr. Set the severity level to INFO so that info logs are printed to stdout. In the log method, get the logger and use the info method to create the log message. Execute the log method with the remote method from the ray module, passing in the log message as an argument.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\\",

The default value for actors was chosen for historical reasons, but it is recommended to always explicitly set `num_cpus` for actors to avoid any surprises.\n\nIf resources are specified explicitly, they are required for both scheduling and running.

If the necessary Kubernetes admin permissions are not available for deploying KubeRay, you can deploy a static Ray cluster to Kubernetes without using KubeRay. However, it should be noted that this deployment method lacks the built-in autoscaling feature that KubeRay provides.\n\nTo enable autoscaling in Ray on Kubernetes, you can use the Ray autoscaler. The Ray autoscaler is a Ray cluster process that automatically scales the cluster up and down based on resource demand. It adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nTo configure the Ray autoscaler, you can set the `enableInTreeAutoscaling` parameter to `true`. The KubeRay operator will then automatically configure an autoscaling sidecar container for the Ray head pod. The autoscaler container collects resource metrics from the Ray cluster and adjusts the replicas field of each workerGroupSpec as needed to fulfill the requirements of your Ray application. You can also set the `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` fields to constrain the number of replicas of an autoscaling workerGroup.\n\nAdditionally, the Ray autoscaler can work in conjunction with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler. After the Ray autoscaler decides to create a Ray pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can provision a Kubernetes node so that the pod can be placed. Similarly, after the Ray autoscaler decides to delete an idle pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can clean up the idle Kubernetes node that remains. It is recommended to configure your RayCluster so that only one Ray pod fits per Kubernetes node.\n\nTo enable Ray autoscaling in the KubeRay RayCluster custom resource config, you can follow the KubeRay quickstart guide and create an autoscaling RayCluster custom resource using the provided YAML file.\n\nPlease note that the provided context does not mention any specific alternative to KubeRay for deploying Ray on Kubernetes.",

Instead, you can use instance variables to hold the global state and pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that when creating a remote actor, you should use `ActorClass.remote()` instead of `ActorClass()`. The latter will raise an exception because actors cannot be instantiated directly.\n\nAn `ActorHandle` can be created in three ways: by calling `.remote()` on an `ActorClass`, by passing an actor handle into a task (forking the `ActorHandle`), or by directly serializing the `ActorHandle` (e.g., with cloudpickle).\n\nI hope this helps!",

However, there are a few things you can check to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Make sure you have properly configured the dashboard for viewing it from outside the head node. When starting a remote Ray cluster, the dashboard port may not be publicly exposed by default. You may need to set up additional configurations to access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node. Refer to the documentation on configuring the dashboard for more details.\n\n2. Ensure that you have set up Prometheus and Grafana along with the Ray Dashboard. These tools are necessary for critical features such as Metrics View. Integrating Prometheus and Grafana with the Ray Dashboard is highly recommended. Refer to the documentation on configuring and managing the dashboard for instructions on setting up Prometheus and Grafana.\n\n3. Check if you have customized the Ray Dashboard port. By default, the Ray Dashboard runs on port 8265 of the head node. If you have changed the port, make sure you are using the correct port when tunneling the dashboard to your machine.\n\n4. If you are using the VM Cluster Launcher, you can securely port-forward local traffic to the dashboard using the `ray dashboard` command. Make sure you have followed the correct syntax and provided the cluster config file. The dashboard should be visible at `http://localhost:8265`.\n\n5. Double-check the URI of your cluster and ensure that you are accessing the Ray Dashboard at the correct port. For example, if you are running Ray Serve locally, you can access the dashboard by going to `http://localhost:8265` in your browser.\n\n6. If you want to monitor the cluster status, you can use the `ray status` command on the head node. Additionally, the Ray Dashboard provides an online dashboard where you can monitor cluster usage and auto-scaling status. You can access it via HTTP on the head node at `localhost:8265`. You can also use the `ray dashboard` command with the cluster configuration file to set up port forwarding automatically and view the remote dashboard in your local browser.\n\nRemember to ensure proper authentication and security measures are in place before exposing the Ray Dashboard publicly.",

            "generated_answer": "To update files in the working directory, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the working directory for the Ray workers. It can be a local existing directory with a total size of up to 100 MiB, a local existing zipped file with a total unzipped size of up to 100 MiB, or a URI to a remotely-stored zip file containing the working directory for your job.\n\n2. Download the specified directory to each node on the cluster. Ray workers will be started in their node's copy of this directory.\n\n3. If you are working in local mode, you can use the `_change_working_directory` context manager to change the working directory to the trial logdir. This can be done using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\nimport os\nimport ray\n\n@contextmanager\ndef _change_working_directory(trial):\n    if ray._private.worker._mode() == ray._private.worker.LOCAL_MODE:\n        old_dir = os.getcwd()\n        try:\n            os.chdir(trial.logdir)\n            yield\n        finally:\n            os.chdir(old_dir)\n    else:\n        yield\n```\n\n4. If you want to disable the behavior of changing the working directory, you can set the flag `chdir_to_trial_dir=False` in `tune.TuneConfig`. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes. Make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\n5. To update the files in the working directory, you can use the `os` module in Python. For example, you can create a new directory or change to an existing directory using `os.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)` and `os.chdir(working_dir)` respectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you can update files in the working directory for your Ray workers.",

            "generated_answer": "The GCS server, or Global Control Service, is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster. It runs on the Ray head node and is responsible for managing node membership, actor directory, and other cluster-level operations such as actor and placement group management.\n\nIf your GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the additional stress placed on the head node in a large cluster deployment. The head node runs extra cluster-level processes like GCS and API server, which can consume more memory. To address this, you can adjust the maximum file descriptors limit per process using the ulimit command. It is recommended to set ulimit -n 65536 in your host configuration or selectively apply it for Ray components.\n\nAdditionally, the head node may have more memory-demanding system components like GCS or the dashboard, and if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes, it can easily experience out-of-memory problems. In such cases, it is advised not to run any tasks and actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node.\n\nFurthermore, since all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, the operating system needs to support the number of network connections created. Tuning the operating system settings to handle the increased number of connections may be necessary.\n\nIt's important to note that the GCS is not fault-tolerant by default, as all data is stored in-memory. If the GCS fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, HA Redis is required. When the GCS restarts, it loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions. During the recovery period, certain functions may not be available.",

The common address used is localhost:6379, but if your cluster has a different address, make sure to use that.\n\n2. Restart the Ray cluster: If your program freezes, you can restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands. Use the following command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\n3. Check IP address mismatch: If you see an error message stating that a node has an IP address that doesn't match the Raylet address, it could be due to connecting the Ray cluster with a different IP address or connecting a container. This can also be caused by overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections. To resolve this, start the worker nodes more slowly.\n\n4. Check worker node availability: If the cluster has no resources to launch Ray worker nodes, you may encounter a timeout. In this case, you can raise a RuntimeError or log a warning message. Check the code snippet provided in the context for reference.\n\n5. Check Docker resource limits: If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can use `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` to check for errors. Ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough. In production scenarios, it is recommended to use larger Ray pods and size each Ray pod to take up an entire Kubernetes node.\n\n6.

Import the necessary libraries and initialize a local Ray cluster:\n```python\nimport ray\nray.init()\n```\n\n2. Create a dataset from different data sources. For example, you can create a dataset from a CSV file stored on S3:\n```python\nds = ray.data.read_csv(\"s3://<bucket>/<folder>/iris.csv\")\n```\n\n3. Perform operations on the dataset. For example, you can display the first record of the dataset:\n```python\nds.show(limit=1)\n```\n\n4. You can also create datasets from synthetic data or in-memory data. Here are some examples:\n```python\n# Create dataset from synthetic data.\nds = ray.data.range(1000)\n\n# Create dataset from in-memory data.\nds = ray.data.from_items([{\"col1\": i, \"col2\": i * 2} for i in range(1000)])\n```\n\n5. If you want to save the dataset back to an external storage system, you can use the `write_csv` method:\n```python\nds.write_csv(\"s3://<bucket>/output\")\n```\n\nNote that Ray Data requires schemas for all datasets in Ray 2.5. Standalone Python objects are no longer supported. Additionally, the default batch format is fixed to NumPy. If you want to revert to the legacy behavior temporarily, you can set the environment variable `RAY_DATA_STRICT_MODE=0` on all cluster processes.\n\nFor more information on creating datasets and using Ray Data, you can refer to the Ray Data documentation: [https://docs.ray.io/en/master/data/faq.html#migrating-to-strict-mode](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/data/faq.html#migrating-to-strict-mode)",

You would typically import the necessary library (ray) and then use the read_csv function to load the data as shown next:\n```python\nimport ray\nds = ray.data.read_csv('s3://[email\u00a0protected]/iris.csv')\n```\n\n2. **Transforming Data:** You can use user-defined functions (UDFs) to transform datasets by applying certain functions with the ```.map_batches()``` method on your dataset:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_batch(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    vec_a = batch['petal length (cm)']\n    vec_b = batch['petal width (cm)']\n    batch['petal area (cm^2)'] = vec_a * vec_b\n    return batch\n\ntransformed_ds = ds.map_batches(transform_batch)\n```\n\n3. **Consuming Data:** You can pass datasets to Ray Tasks or Actors and access records with methods like ```take_batch()``` and ```iter_batches()```. Here's an example of using take_batch:\n\n```python\nprint(transformed_ds.take_batch(batch_size=3))\n```\nand an example of using tasks and actors:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef consume(ds: ray.data.Dataset) -> int:\n    num_batches = 0\n    for batch in ds.iter_batches(batch_size=8):\n        num_batches += 1\n    return num_batches\n\nray.get(consume.remote(transformed_ds))\n```\n\n4. **Saving Data:** Finally, you can save dataset contents to local or remote filesystems. You'd typically use the write_parquet() function:\n\n```python\nimport os\ntransformed_ds.write_parquet('/tmp/iris')\nprint(os.listdir('/tmp/iris'))\n```",

So, it's convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n\nTo view the logs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a simple deployment that logs a custom log message when it's queried. For example, you can create a file named `monitoring.py` and define your deployment there.\n\n2. Run your Serve application.\n\n3. Keep the driver running and view the logs that it emits.\n\nAdditionally, you can access the logs from Ray clusters using the Ray logging CLI.

These logs are located under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` in both the head node pod and worker node pod. They provide information about specific deployment failure reasons and autoscaling events.\n\nYou can also find a copy of these logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. To parse these stored logs, you can use a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to search by deployment or replica. Serve supports log rotation of these logs by setting the environment variables `RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES` and `RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT`. \n\nTo silence the replica-level logs or configure logging, you can configure the \"ray.serve\" logger inside the deployment constructor:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"ray.serve\")\n```\n\nRay Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors to stderr and on disk on each node at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. This includes system-level logs from the Serve controller and HTTP proxy, as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n\nTo troubleshoot application deployment failures in Serve, you can check the Kuberay operator logs by running `kubectl logs -f <kuberay-operator-pod-name>`. The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the Ray dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application's states.

Then, we use the `filter` method to create a subset of the dataset by applying a filter condition. The resulting `subset_ds` will contain only the elements that satisfy the filter condition.\n\nYou can also create a Ray Dataset from other sources and file formats, such as Parquet files.

By default, Ray reserves 30% of available memory for the object store. The size of the object store can be controlled by the --object-store-memory flag. The memory is allocated to /dev/shm (shared memory) for Linux and /tmp (disk) for MacOS. The object store shared memory is the memory used when your application reads objects via ray.get.

This provides GPU isolation and ensures that tasks are assigned to the available GPUs.\n\nTo install Ray on your M1 laptop, you can follow the official installation instructions. Ray currently officially supports Apple silicon (M1) hardware, along with x86_64 and aarch64 (ARM) for Linux. However, please note that Ray on Windows is currently in beta.\n\nOnce Ray is installed and configured, you can use it with GPU support by specifying the GPU resource requirements for your tasks or actors.

The directory specified by RAY_TEMPDIR needs to be accessible by the host, the outer container, and the inner container.\n\nFor example, if you want to set the temporary directory to \"/ray-mount\", you can set the RAY_TEMPDIR environment variable to \"/ray-mount\". In this case, the outer container can be started with the command `-v /ray:/ray-mount` to mount the directory \"/ray\" on the host to \"/ray-mount\" in the outer container.\n\nIf you are running on a remote cluster, you need to ensure that the import path is accessible. You can deploy to the remote cluster by specifying the cluster address using the `serve deploy` command. For example, if the address of the remote cluster is \"http://127.0.0.1:52365\", you can deploy to this address using the command `serve deploy config_file.yaml -a http://127.0.0.1:52365`.\n\nTo access the Ray Dashboard agent on a remote cluster, you can set the dashboard agent's port using the `--dashboard-agent-listen-port` argument when running `ray start`. By default, the Ray Dashboard agent listens on port 52365.\n\nIf you are using a remote cluster and want to access the dashboard port over HTTP, you can set up port forwarding from your local machine to the head node of the cluster. One way to do this is by using the `ray dashboard` command with the cluster configuration file. For example, if your cluster configuration file is \"cluster.yaml\", you can run `ray dashboard cluster.yaml` on your local machine to set up the port forwarding.\n\nRemember to substitute the appropriate IP address or configuration file path in the commands mentioned above based on your specific setup.",

Check that the Ray GCS (Global Control Service) with a matching version has started successfully at the specified address. Ensure that the IP address and port are correct.\n\n2. Verify that there are no firewall settings preventing access to the specified IP address. You can use the command \"ip route get xx.xx.xx.xx\" on the worker node to debug any routing issues.\n\n3. If the worker node cannot access the IP address given, it may result in a failure to connect. Ensure that the worker node has proper network connectivity to the head node.\n\n4. If the worker node is unable to connect to the head node, you may see failures in the log related to this issue.\n\nIt's important to note that the GCS is not fault-tolerant by default, meaning that if the GCS fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, you need to use HA Redis. When the GCS restarts, it loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you can refer to the troubleshooting section for additional possible causes, such as the head node not running, a different version of Ray running at the specified address, or firewall settings preventing access.\n\nPlease note that the provided context contains some code snippets and descriptions related to Ray and GCS, but they may not directly address the specific error you mentioned.",

The DAGDriver also has an optional keyword argument called http_adapter, which allows you to use HTTP adapters to handle HTTP parsing before passing the request into the graph. Ray Serve provides a few built-in HTTP adapters for convenience.\n\nTo run the call graph, you need to use a driver. Ray Serve provides the DAGDriver for this purpose. You can bind your call graph to the DAGDriver and use it to process incoming requests based on the graph.\n\nIn addition, when using a Serve deployment graph, you can configure the DAGDriver to accept an HTTP adapter via its http_adapter field. This allows you to parse JSON or handle other HTTP request formats before passing them into the graph.\n\nTo deploy the application to a local Ray cluster, you can use the `serve deploy` command. After deployment, you can use `serve status` to check the status of your deployments at runtime.\n\nNote that when using `serve build`, the runtime_env field will always be empty and must be set manually.

Increase the available memory: Objects are spilled to external storage when the object store is full. To avoid this, you can increase the available memory for the object store.\n\n2. Optimize object serialization: Ray uses object serialization to store and retrieve objects. By optimizing the serialization process, you can reduce the size of the objects and potentially avoid spilling.\n\n3. Configure the object spilling directory: By default, objects are spilled to Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem. However, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `ray.init()` function. Specify the desired directory path to store the spilled objects.\n\n4. Monitor and manage memory usage: Keep track of the memory usage in your Ray application. If you notice that the object store is frequently filling up, you may need to optimize your code or allocate more resources to handle the workload.\n\n5. Utilize locality scheduling: Ray has a feature called locality scheduling, which prefers to schedule compute tasks on nodes that already have a local copy of the object. This reduces the need to transfer objects between nodes in the cluster and can help avoid spilling.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can minimize the chances of objects getting spilled in Ray and optimize the performance of your data processing workloads.",

You can specify single or multiple directories to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple devices. It's recommended to use an SSD for memory-intensive workloads, and if you're using an HDD, specify a large buffer size to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, Ray will throw 'OutOfDiskError' if the disk utilization exceeds a predefined threshold. You can adjust this threshold using the 'local_fs_capacity_threshold' setting. Also, object spilling to remote storage is possible using 'smart_open', although this feature is still experimental.",

For example:\n   ```python\n   ray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n   ```\n\n3. The other replicas can continue processing requests while the killed replica is restarted. Eventually, the replica will restart and continue serving requests.\n\nNote: If you want to kill the Serve controller, you can use a similar approach. Get a handle to the Serve controller using the NAME from the ray list actor output, and then use `ray.kill()` to kill the controller. Set `no_restart` to `True` to prevent the controller from being restarted.\n\nAfter you're done testing, you can shut down Ray Serve by interrupting the serve run command (e.g., with Ctrl-C). This will gracefully shut down Ray Serve and remove any replicas or deployments.\n\nTo simulate a Serve controller failure, you can manually kill the Serve actor. If you're running KubeRay, you can use the `kubectl get pods` command to find the pods and then use `kubectl exec` to execute commands within the pod.\n\nSimilarly, when Ray Serve scales down and terminates replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them.
